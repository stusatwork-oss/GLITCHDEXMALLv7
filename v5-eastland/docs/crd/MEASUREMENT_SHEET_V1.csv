# CRITICAL SCALE ANCHORS SUMMARY
#
# PRIMARY ANCHOR: Escalator Steps (ESF-001, ESF-002)
# - 12 steps visible in photo 3085976410
# - Standard rise: 8 inches per step
# - Total Z-level descent: 96 inches = 8 feet
# - CONFIDENCE: HIGH
# - USE: Establishes Z0 to Z-1 vertical dimension
#
# SECONDARY ANCHOR: Glass Block Wall (GBF-001)
# - ~28 blocks vertical, ~45 blocks horizontal (curved arc)
# - Assumed block size: 6"x6" (standard glass block)
# - Vertical: 28 blocks × 6" = 14 feet
# - Horizontal arc: 45 blocks × 6" = 22.5 feet
# - CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM (assumes 6" blocks, not 8")
# - USE: Wall height and curvature radius
#
# TERTIARY ANCHOR: Balcony Railing (RBF-001, RBF-002)
# - Standard commercial railing: 42 inches
# - Visible in multiple photos
# - CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM (standard code height)
# - USE: Upper level corridor scaling
#
# QUATERNARY ANCHOR: Door Frames (DRF-001)
# - Standard commercial door: 80 inches (6'8")
# - CONFIDENCE: HIGH (universal standard)
# - USE: Corridor height when doors visible
#
# GEOMETRIC COUNTS (Non-scalable but structurally important)
# - Truss mast radial cables: 32 cables (TMF-001)
# - Fountain tiers: 4 levels (FTF-001)
# - Escalator step count: 12 steps (ESF-001)
#
# MEASUREMENT PRIORITY ORDER FOR MAP CONSTRUCTION:
# 1. Count escalator steps (HIGH confidence) → Establishes Z-level delta = 8 feet
# 2. Count glass blocks (MEDIUM confidence) → Establishes wall dimensions
# 3. Use railing height (MEDIUM confidence) → Establishes corridor scale
# 4. Use door height (HIGH confidence) → Verify corridor heights
# 5. Count structural elements (cables, tiers, columns) → Verify geometry
#
# LIMITATIONS:
# - No vending machine visible with measurable dimensions in photo 3085977904
# - Coca-Cola store shows glass frontage but no clear 39"x72" vending machine reference
# - Truss mast height is estimated (35 feet) without ground reference
# - Roof span is very rough estimate without site plans
# - All pixel counts are approximate due to perspective distortion
#
# NEXT STEPS:
# 1. Use escalator step count (12 steps × 8" = 8 feet) as PRIMARY vertical reference
# 2. Calculate glass block wall dimensions (28v × 45h blocks at 6" = 14' × 22.5')
# 3. Cross-reference with standard building code dimensions (doors, railings)
# 4. Create geometric model using counted elements (32 cables, 4 fountain tiers)
# 5. Document uncertainty ranges for all estimates
