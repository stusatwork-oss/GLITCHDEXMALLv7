# LAYER 2: FUNCTIONAL SEMANTIC ZONES ⭐

**Purpose:** Meaning-based classification for AI understanding - WHAT does this photo show?

**This is THE MOST IMPORTANT layer** for AI-native development.

## Directories

- **`architectural_features/`** - Columns, masts, tensile roof, structural elements, civic-scale components
- **`lighting_conditions/`** - Natural light, fluorescent, dim, shadows, light quality variations
- **`material_patterns/`** - Glass block, tile, carpet, concrete, surface textures, material details
- **`signage_and_wayfinding/`** - Directional signs, store signs, maps, informational displays
- **`reflections_and_mirrors/`** - Reflective surfaces, glass, water reflections, mirror effects
- **`storefronts_closed/`** - Shuttered stores, vacant spaces, papered windows
- **`storefronts_open/`** - Active retail, window displays, operating businesses
- **`abandoned_elements/`** - Decay, neglect, deterioration, abandonment signs
- **`flooring_patterns/`** - Floor materials, patterns, wear, tile layouts

## Why This Matters

AI uses these categories to:
- ✓ Write canon documents
- ✓ Define zone characteristics
- ✓ Build environmental logic
- ✓ Understand Cloud-level moods
- ✓ Detect aesthetic rules
- ✓ Recognize contradictions
- ✓ Place NPCs correctly
- ✓ Write Sora 3-anchor location guides

## Classification Rules

1. **Photos can be in MULTIPLE semantic categories** (multi-tag encouraged)
2. This is an "index of meaning," not just an index of images
3. Cross-reference with `/ai/sora/` prompt templates
4. Links to `ai/mallOS/` environmental state

## Usage

Layer 2 answers: **"What does this SHOW?"** (multiple answers OK)

Examples:
- Photo showing escalator with natural light from roof → `architectural_features/` + `lighting_conditions/`
- Photo of abandoned store with reflection → `storefronts_closed/` + `reflections_and_mirrors/`
- Photo of tile floor pattern under fluorescent light → `flooring_patterns/` + `lighting_conditions/`
