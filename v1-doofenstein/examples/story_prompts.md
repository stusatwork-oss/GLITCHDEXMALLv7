# Story Prompts – Using the Mall Engine as a Narrative Generator

The Glitchdex Mall Engine generates playable stories through:
1. **Random artifact discovery** (what the player finds shapes narrative)
2. **NPC dialogue & reactions** (Milo tells artifact histories)
3. **Time-based escalation** (invisible pressure that reveals itself)
4. **Session logs** (raw transcript of the play experience)

## Prompt: "Artifact Haunts"

### Setup
Run the game and collect 5+ artifacts. Don't rush to the exit. Document which artifacts appear.

### Story Generation
Use Milo's lore + collected artifacts to build a meta-narrative:

**Example Result:**
```
Artifacts found this session:
1. Sunglasses (1994, kid who vanished)
2. Sticker sheets (1998 rave, everyone moved away)
3. Gift card (2003 store, $50 unclaimed)
4. Film roll (1989, photos blank/overexposed)
5. Leather wallet (1996, mystery owner)

Narrative connection:
"The mall is a gateway. Every decade, it swallows something.
The 80s took the photos no one should see. The 90s took kids and crowds.
The 00s took commerce itself. And something keeps watch."
```

## Prompt: "The Panic"

### Setup
Record session log, especially audio messages and chaos events.

### Story Generation
Use the log to write the subjective experience:

```
[00:00] "I entered the mall with my mom's credit card.
        Parking lot visible through the glass.
        Everything normal."

[05:00] "First cry. Distant. Ignore it."

[05:45] "Another cry. Can't place where.
        Milo at the counter, he heard it too.
        'That sound... what is that?'"

[10:30] "The voices are constant now.
        I've picked up four strange things.
        The sunglasses, the stickers, the wallet...
        The colors feel wrong. Everything shimmer."

[15:00] "SCREAMING.
        Not from speakers. From the walls.
        From the vents. From everywhere.
        The shadow—I don't know what the shadow is.
        But it's watching."

[16:45] "I ran.
        Made it to the entrance.
        Pushed through.
        Outside, my mom asked if I found everything.
        I looked back.
        The doors were closing.
        For just a moment, I heard... giggling?"
```

## Prompt: "Milo's Testimony"

### Setup
Play the game and interact with Milo multiple times, collecting artifact lore.

### Story Generation
Compile Milo's dialogue into a single monologue:

```
MILO'S STORY (Edited from session transcript)

"You know, I've worked here for six years. Never quite figured out why I took
the job. Overqualified for optometry, underqualified for retail.

These sunglasses? 1994. Kid named... I don't remember his name. His parents
still come here sometimes, look lost. They never reported him missing.

The stickers are worse. Rave promotion, 1998. Everyone who had them—and I
mean *everyone*—moved away in the same month. I checked the old address registry.
They're all gone. Just gone.

This wallet. 1996. No ID. Just receipts from stores that don't exist anymore.
What was this person buying? Why was their entire month erased?

And the voices... I didn't want to tell you this, but I've heard them before.
In the late afternoons. Especially in the service corridors. Like something
lost in the vents, crying for its mother.

You should leave. Please. I'm serious. This place... it collects things."
```

## Prompt: "Mall as Entity"

### Setup
Document ALL chaos events from a full session. Note shadow intensity over time.

### Story Generation
Anthropomorphize the mall itself:

```
THE MALL AWAKENS

Stage 1 (5 min): The mall breathes. Distant cries—its infant attention.
Stage 2 (15 min): The mall wakes. Shadows move with purpose.
Stage 3 (20+ min): The mall feeds. Chaos events as it shakes itself awake.

Escalators rattle. Lights strobe. The shadow fills corridors.
The mall is not haunted. The mall is haunting.
It is the predator. We are passing through its throat.
```

## Prompt: "Why Artifacts Exist"

### Setup
Use artifacts + Milo's lore + playtime to answer: Why are these objects in the mall?

### Story Generation
Create artifact folklore:

```
The Mall's Collection

Objects don't disappear. They migrate.
When you lose something, it goes to the mall.
The mall is the destination for forgotten things.

The sunglasses—a boy who vanished.
The wallet—a person erased.
The stickers—an entire cohort, gone same day.
The film—images that shouldn't exist.

Milo tends the collection. Keeper of the lost.
The invisible thing in the mall? Maybe it's guarding them.
Or maybe it *is* them. All of them. Every lost thing, accumulated.
Crying because they want to leave."
```

## Prompt: "Generational Haunting"

### Setup
Note the dates of artifacts found. What pattern emerges?

### Story Generation
Track the mall through decades:

```
1987: The food tray sits, fossilizing.
1989: Photos are taken. Exposures fail.
1994: A child vanishes.
1996: A wallet is left, owner unknown.
1998: Raver stickers appear. Recipients flee.
2003: A store dies. $50 card never redeemed.

The mall ages. Each decade, it takes something.
Each decade, something is left behind as proof.
What will it take from us?"
```

## How to Use These Prompts

1. **Play the game** (capture session_log.txt)
2. **Identify key elements**:
   - Which artifacts were found?
   - What did Milo say about them?
   - When did each toddler stage trigger?
   - What chaos events occurred?
3. **Write the story** using those elements as anchors
4. **Vary perspective**:
   - First-person (player's panic)
   - Third-person (external observer)
   - Milo's perspective
   - The mall's perspective
   - The toddler's perspective (never seen, only felt)

## The Engine as Myth Generator

Every session produces:
- A **narrative log** (timestamps, events, dialogue)
- A **spatial record** (which tiles were visited, NPCs encountered)
- An **artifact trail** (what was found, Milo's lore, weirdness generated)
- An **emotional arc** (calm → curiosity → unease → panic)

These can be combined to generate endless variations on a single myth:
*"The mall is alive. It consumes what it wants, and collects what falls through cracks."*

The invisible toddler is just the most recent manifestation.
