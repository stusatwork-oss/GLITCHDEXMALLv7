YOU ESCAPED

You push through the doors into the parking lot.
Your mom is waiting in the car, shopping bags in the trunk.
'Did you find everything you wanted?' she asks.
You look back at the mall entrance.
For a moment, you swear you hear crying from inside.

Final playtime: 16:45
Artifacts collected: 4
```

## Key Mechanics Demonstrated

1. **Time = Intensity**: Longer play = more dread
2. **Artifact Discovery**: Random objects are found and carried
3. **Milo's Lore**: NPCs tell stories, creating narrative
4. **Toddler Presence**: Escalates through audio, shadow, chaos
5. **Forced Exit**: Only way to escape is through entrance
6. **Weirdness Boost**: Multiple artifacts amplify toddler intensity
7. **No Fail State**: Player can't "lose," just gets more panicked

## Possible Variations

- **Quick Run** (5 min): Player finds entrance cries at 5 min, leaves immediately
- **Curious Run** (20+ min): Player explores all locations, collects most artifacts, reaches stage 2 fully
- **Escape Run**: Player ignores artifacts, rushes to find entrance under chaos
- **Artifact Runner**: Player collects all 8 artifacts, maximizes weirdness, barely escapes
