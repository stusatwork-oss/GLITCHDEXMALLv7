REGISTRATION
═════════════

Many programs on this CD are SHAREWARE - try before you buy!
If you enjoy a program, please register to support the developer.
Most programs include registration information in their README files.

Some programs are FREEWARE - absolutely free to use and distribute.
Others are DEMO versions - limited functionality until registered.


TROUBLESHOOTING
═══════════════

If a program won't launch:
  • Make sure you have enough free disk space
  • Check system requirements
  • Try running from Windows 95 in Safe Mode
  • Some old programs require DOS mode

If the CD menu won't work:
  • Try running from a DOS command prompt
  • Check that CDROM drive is properly configured
  • Reinstall from the original CD (use Install Disk 1 of 3)


ABOUT THIS COLLECTION
═════════════════════

GAMEZILLA MEGA COLLECTION represents years of careful curation,
selecting the finest shareware from 1995-1998. Every program has been
tested and verified for quality and functionality.

This collection captures the golden age of shareware distribution -
before the internet changed everything. These programs represent the
creativity and ingenuity of independent software developers.

Many of these programs are now ABANDONWARE - no longer actively
developed but still functional and collectible.


DISCLAIMER
══════════

This CD is provided AS-IS. While all programs have been tested,
we cannot guarantee compatibility with all systems. Always read
the README file before installing any program.

Some programs may require registration codes or serial numbers
available from their developers.


ENJOY!
══════

Thank you for purchasing GAMEZILLA MEGA COLLECTION VOL. 4!
