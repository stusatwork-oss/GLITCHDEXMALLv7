## RECONSTRUCTION RECOMMENDATIONS

### For NeRF:
1. **Start with fountain as origin point** - visible in 6+ photos from multiple levels
2. **Use yellow tower as vertical reference** - consistent across many ground floor shots
3. **Escalator angles are critical** - connect Level 0 to Level -1 geometry
4. **Glass elevator provides scale** - visible from 3 distinct positions
5. **Human figure in 3085986996** - provides scale reference

### For Luma:
1. **Strong corridor perspectives** - 3085977114, 3085986996 provide depth
2. **Multi-level coverage** - Multiple photos show vertical relationships
3. **Architectural features** - Glass blocks, columns, arches provide reconstruction anchors
4. **Lighting consistency** - Most photos well-lit (some food court shots very dark)

### Coverage Gaps:
- ❌ No traditional top-down directory map found
- ❌ Limited coverage of theater interior (only entrance visible)
- ❌ Service corridors underrepresented
- ❌ Anchor store mostly empty (lacks detail geometry)
- ✅ Excellent fountain coverage (6+ angles)
- ✅ Good escalator/elevator coverage (multiple levels)
- ✅ Strong corridor perspective shots

## NEXT STEPS FOR 3D RECONSTRUCTION

1. **Extract EXIF data** from photos (if available) for actual camera parameters
2. **Manually annotate feature points** across photo pairs (fountain, elevator, tower)
3. **Group photos by zone** for sequential NeRF processing
4. **Establish coordinate system** using fountain as origin (0,0,0)
5. **Process in passes**:
   - Pass 1: Ground floor (Level 0) only
   - Pass 2: Food court (Level -1) only
   - Pass 3: Merge levels using escalator/elevator connection photos
6. **Scale verification** using human figure in 3085986996
