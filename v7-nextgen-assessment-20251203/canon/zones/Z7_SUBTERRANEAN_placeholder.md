# Z7_SUBTERRANEAN - UNVERIFIED PLACEHOLDER

**Zone ID:** Z7_SUBTERRANEAN
**Status:** UNVERIFIED PLACEHOLDER
**Access:** EXTERIOR POINTS ONLY - Interior off-limits forever
**Version:** 7.0.0-alpha
**Source:** v5-eastland integration (user answer 7-A)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL STATUS NOTICE

**This zone is a PLACEHOLDER based on architectural inference.**

- **Interior access:** OFF-LIMITS FOREVER
- **Photo evidence:** 0 photos of interior
- **Verification status:** UNVERIFIED
- **Documentation strategy:** Exterior access points only (ramps, vents, service doors)

**DO NOT implement interior geometry without photographic evidence.**

  "zone_id": "Z7_SUBTERRANEAN",
  "name": "Subterranean Access Deck",
  "level": -2,
  "elevation_feet": -16,
  "status": "UNVERIFIED_PLACEHOLDER",

## HYPOTHETICAL DESCRIPTION

If this zone exists (unverified), it would contain:

### Infrastructure (Typical Mall Subterranean)
- Vehicle access ramp from exterior
- Truck loading docks
- Loading bays for anchor stores
- Service corridors
- Employee circulation networks
- Mechanical rooms
- Electrical/HVAC distribution
- Storage areas
- Waste management infrastructure

### Spatial Estimate
- **Area:** Possibly 200,000+ sq ft (part of 1M+ total footprint)
- **Depth:** ~16 feet below ground level (Z=-2)
- **Access:** Service ramp from exterior (Z9)
- **Connections:** Service elevators to anchor stores (Z5)

---

## DOCUMENTED FEATURES (Exterior Only)

### What CAN Be Documented
1. **Exterior service ramp location** (if visible in parking lot photos)
2. **Vent stacks** (visible from exterior)
3. **Service door locations** (exterior building perimeter)
4. **Loading dock positions** (relative to anchor stores)
5. **Mechanical equipment** (roof-mounted or exterior-visible)

### Photo Target List
- Parking lot service ramp entry/exit
- Building perimeter service doors
- Vent stack positions
- Truck access routes
- Exterior loading dock areas

---

## ADJACENCY (Hypothetical)

**Connects to (if exists):**
- Z5_ANCHOR_STORES (service elevators, loading access)
- Z9_EXTERIOR (vehicle ramp, service doors)

**Does NOT connect to:**
- Z3_LOWER_RING (no customer-facing access)
- Z4_FOOD_COURT (separate service infrastructure)
- Z6_THEATER (separate service access)

---

## TEMPORAL VARIANCE

### All Eras (1981-2011)
**Status:** Hypothetically operational throughout mall life
**Function:** Service infrastructure (if exists)
**Access:** Restricted to employees, delivery, maintenance

**Note:** No timeline variance data - no photos across any era.

---

## DESIGN INTENT (Speculative)

### Architectural Context
For a 1,000,000+ sq ft megastructure like Eastland Mall:
- Subterranean service infrastructure is **typical**
- KKT likely designed separation of service/customer circulation
- 1980s large malls commonly used underground loading
- "Space station with parking lot" scale suggests substantial below-ground support

### Why It Might Exist
- Anchor stores (100,000+ sq ft each) require truck loading
- Mall this scale needs centralized mechanical systems
- Customer-facing spaces kept clean via hidden service access
- 1981 construction would have included modern service infrastructure

### Why It's Unverified
- No interior photos in any collection
- Access restricted or sealed post-closure
- Service areas not photographed for archival/nostalgia purposes
- Interior may be hazardous, flooded, or structurally compromised

---

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

### For Voxel Construction
- **DO NOT** model interior geometry
- **ONLY** create exterior access point markers
- **PLACEHOLDER** volumes only (indicate zone exists but is inaccessible)

### For Gameplay
- **DO NOT** allow player access to interior
- **MAY** reference in lore/dialogue: *"There's a whole level below us. Locked. Forever."*
- **CAN** create atmospheric hints: service elevator that won't descend, locked doors, muffled sounds from below

### For LLM DM Narration
**Acceptable narrative hooks:**
- "You notice a service ramp descending into darkness at the parking lot edge."
- "A locked steel door marked 'AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY - SUBTERRANEAN ACCESS.'"
- "The janitor mentions the 'downstairs' but won't elaborate."
- "Faint mechanical hum from below - the bones of the building."

**DO NOT narrate:**
- Interior descriptions without evidence
- Specific room layouts or contents
- Detailed service corridor networks
- Functional status of equipment

**Maintain mystery - absence is canon.**

---

## FUTURE VERIFICATION

### V2+ Fidelity Pass Goals
1. Locate exterior photos showing service ramps
2. Identify vent stack positions in aerial/parking lot photos
3. Document service door locations on building perimeter
4. Map loading dock positions relative to anchor stores
5. **DO NOT** invent interior without photographic evidence

### Photo Targets
- Parking lot overviews (ramp visibility)
- Building exterior perimeter shots
- Aerial/satellite imagery (service access patterns)
- Construction-period photos (may show infrastructure build-out)

## FINAL REMINDER

**The interior is OFF-LIMITS.**
**Exterior access points can be documented.**
**Absence is canon.**
**Speculation must be clearly marked.**

**RESPECT THE UNKNOWN.**

*This zone exists in the space between verified and imagined.*
*Document what can be seen. Respect what cannot.*
