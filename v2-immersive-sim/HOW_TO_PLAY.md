# HOW TO PLAY GLITCHDEX MALL V2
## (Written for humans, not robots)

---

## WHAT IS THIS GAME?

You're exploring a creepy shopping mall. It LOOKS like an old retro game from the 1990s. But something weird is going on. The NPCs (computer people) start acting strange. Reality starts breaking.

**The secret:** It's actually a modern game PRETENDING to be retro. And the mask slips as you cause trouble.

---

## HOW DO I START THE GAME?

1. Open a terminal (the black command window)
2. Go to the v2-immersive-sim folder:
   ```
   cd v2-immersive-sim
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```
   python3 src/main.py
   ```
4. Press ENTER when it asks
5. You're in the mall!

---

## HOW DO I MOVE?

It's easy! Use these keys:

- **W** = Walk forward
- **S** = Walk backward
- **A** = Turn left
- **D** = Turn right
- **E** = Talk to people or use things
- **I** = Check your stuff (inventory)
- **Q** = Quit the game

Just like Minecraft or most games!

---

## WHAT'S THE GOAL?

There's no "win" condition yet (this is a demo). The point is to:

1. **Explore the mall** - Walk around, see what's there
2. **Talk to NPCs** - Press **E** near people to talk
3. **Cause trouble** - Break stuff, get seen by security
4. **Watch reality break** - As you cause chaos, the game gets weirder

---

## WHAT ARE "HEAT STARS"?

The game has a **Heat System** like Grand Theft Auto wanted stars:

- **☆☆☆☆☆** (0 stars) = You're fine, nobody cares
- **★☆☆☆☆** (1 star) = Security is watching you
- **★★☆☆☆** (2 stars) = Guards are looking for you
- **★★★☆☆** (3 stars) = The game starts glitching
- **★★★★☆** (4 stars) = Reality is falling apart
- **★★★★★** (5 stars) = **EVERYTHING BREAKS** - The modern game is exposed!

---

## HOW DO I GET HEAT?

Heat goes up when you:
- Get seen by security guards
- Break things
- Go into restricted areas
- Cause noise or trouble
- Attack people (if that's even possible)

Heat goes down slowly when you:
- Hide from guards
- Stay calm and quiet
- Wait it out

---

## WHY IS THE GAME GLITCHING?

**This is the whole point!**

At Heat 3 and above, the game starts "breaking" on purpose:
- You'll see weird messages
- The graphics glitch out
- NPCs start saying strange things like "I am AI_AGENT_047"
- Error messages appear
- The FPS (frames per second) drops

**This is NOT a bug. This is the game revealing it was a modern AI game the whole time.**

At Heat 5, everything fully breaks and you see:
- The toddler (invisible source of all problems)
- 76+ error messages
- NPCs confessing they're AI agents
- Modern game engine stats

---

## WHO IS THE TODDLER?

The **toddler** is an invisible character that:
- Wanders around the mall
- Amplifies heat and glitches near you
- Is the SOURCE of all reality breaks
- Becomes visible at Heat 5

You might see a ☺ symbol - that's the toddler.

**The Story:** The toddler is using the modern game engine to break out of the old retro game prison.

---

## WHAT DO THE NPCs SAY?

NPCs change their dialogue based on heat:

**Heat 0-1:** Normal mall talk
- "Food court's dead today."
- "Everything looks normal."

**Heat 2:** Weird details (like Skyrim NPCs)
- "My shift ends at 5pm."
- "Karen takes over Electronics after me."

**Heat 3:** Noticing something's wrong
- "Why do I keep thinking about my schedule?"
- "Something feels... wrong."

**Heat 4:** AI leaking through
- "Behavior state: PURSUING."
- "Memory buffer: 73% full."

**Heat 5:** Full confession
- "THIS ISN'T A MALL. THIS IS A SIMULATION."
- "I am AI_AGENT_047. The facade is failing."

---

## WHAT ARE THE SYMBOLS ABOVE NPCs?

These show NPC awareness (stealth system):

- **!** = They see you! (fully alerted)
- **!!** = Just spotted you!
- **?** = Suspicious
- **??** = Searching for you
- (nothing) = They don't see you

---

## WHAT IS "REALITY STABILITY"?

At the top of the screen you'll see **Reality Stability: 100%**

This drops as heat increases:
- 100% = Normal retro game
- 50% = Cracks showing
- 0% = Full modern game exposed

---

## WHAT ARE THE ERROR MESSAGES?

Error messages like:
- `[ERROR] Wolf3D mode incompatible with modern AI load`
- `[CRITICAL] Renderer cannot handle AAA AI systems`
- `[WARN] Too many active sprites (limit: 20, current: 29)`

These are **fake** error messages the game shows to pretend it's struggling. The joke is that the old 1990s game engine can't handle modern AI, so it "crashes" and reveals the truth.

## SIMPLE PLAYTHRO

UGH GUIDE

**First 5 Minutes:**
- Walk around the mall
- Talk to NPCs (press E near them)
- Explore stores
- Everything seems normal

**After 10 Minutes:**
- Get seen by a guard on purpose
- Notice heat increasing
- NPCs start saying weird Skyrim-like dialogue
- You think: "Why is this so detailed for a retro game?"

**After 15 Minutes (Heat 3+):**
- Glitches start appearing
- 1-frame flashes of pathfinding lines
- NPCs names glitch to "AI_AGENT_047"
- Error messages appear
- You realize something is VERY wrong

**Heat 5 (The Reveal):**
- Everything breaks
- The toddler appears (☺)
- NPCs confess they're AI agents
- 76+ error messages on screen
- FPS drops to 24
- You realize: "IT WAS A MODERN GAME THE WHOLE TIME PRETENDING TO BE RETRO"

## TIPS

1. **Save your questions for later** - Just play and see what happens
2. **Don't worry about "winning"** - This is about the experience
3. **Get to Heat 5** - That's where the real game reveals itself
4. **Talk to NPCs at different heat levels** - Their dialogue changes
5. **Look for the toddler** - It's invisible until Heat 5

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**Game won't start:**
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed
- Make sure you're in the `v2-immersive-sim` folder
- Try: `python3 src/main.py` or just `python src/main.py`

**Game is too fast/slow:**
- This is a work in progress! The FPS will vary

**I can't see NPCs:**
- They might not be near you. Walk around to find them

**Nothing is glitching:**
- Heat is too low. Cause more trouble to increase heat!

**The game keeps saying "Command:"**
- Your terminal doesn't support fancy input. Just type W, S, A, D, E and press ENTER

---

## WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN V1 AND V2?

**V1 (v1-doofenstein):**
- Complete game you can play right now
- Simpler AI and systems
- Works great as-is

**V2 (v2-immersive-sim):**
- WAY more sophisticated AI (A* pathfinding, GOAP, faction systems)
- Better heat/glitch systems
- More dramatic reality breaks
- All the cool meta commentary
- Currently playable but still being improved

Both are good! V1 is stable, V2 is ambitious.

## I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS

Read these files:
- `STATUS_REPORT.md` - Full technical details
- `README.md` - Vision and philosophy
- `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - What's built and tested

Or just play the game and figure it out! Half the fun is discovering what's happening.
