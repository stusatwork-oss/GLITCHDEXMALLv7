# NPC Spine Index
**Identity Cores • Domain Locks • Never-Lists**

This file catalogs the anchor NPCs of the Glitchdex Mall.
Each entry defines:

- **Domain Lock** — what they are about, always.
- **Never-List** — negative constraints that stabilize them.
- **Rituals** — repeated patterns of behavior.
- **Props** — objects that act as identity anchors.
- **Cloud Influence** — how they modulate the mall's emotional weather.
- **Zones** — where they naturally "live."

**Future LLMs should extend, not overwrite this file.**
