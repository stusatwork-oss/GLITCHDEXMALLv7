# MallOS README
**Worldbrain • Cloud State Logic • Zone Physics**

MallOS is the meta-operating system of the Glitchdex Mall universe.
It governs world physics, emotional weather, zone adjacency, character stability, and Cloud behavior.

If Sora is the camera,
and Spynt is the firmware,
**MallOS is the brain.**

This folder defines the rules of the world.

---

## 🧠 1. What MallOS Is

MallOS is NOT "lore."
It is NOT "backstory."

**MallOS is:**

- a simulation layer
- a narrative physics system
- a spatial meaning engine
- a character drift stabilizer
- a Cloud regulator
- a memory organ

Every Sora shot, Spynt identity spine, and AI collaborator note flows through MallOS rules.

## ☁️ 2. Cloud State Fundamentals

**The Cloud is the mall's emotional + narrative + spatial pressure system.**

It tracks:

- vibe buildup
- contradiction spikes
- identity drift
- zone instability
- foot traffic density
- temporal anomalies
- unresolved narrative loops

### Cloud can be:

- calm
- heavy
- volatile
- fractured
- humming
- escalating
- in bleed state

**Cloud state determines how the mall "feels" and how stable shots will be.**

---

## 🏬 3. Zone Architecture

The mall is divided into **microzones**, each with its own physics and identity gravity.

### Sample zones include:

- Food Court
- Atrium
- Hard Copy Corridor (beaded curtain adjacency)
- Arcade
- Dead Wing (Mattress Store)
- Service Halls
- Escalator Mirrors
- Old Department Store Shells
- Security Office
- Maintenance Sublevels

### Zones influence:

- light behavior
- sound resonance
- Cloud accumulation
- character drift
- prop behavior
- NPC emotional consistency

### ⚠️ ZONE RULE:

**Zones ALWAYS override character logic if there is a conflict.**

---

## 🧩 4. Anchors

**Anchors are stable identity nodes the mall uses to avoid collapse.**

### Examples:

- Hard Copy (the wife)
- Arcade Guy (the user)
- Anthro-coded Security
- Maintenance Monks (impossible clipboards)
- Uncle Danny
- Rusty
- Lost & Found
- Beaded Curtain Corridor
- Foodcourt_2010.mp4
- The 1986 Tensile Roof

**Anchors "pin" the Cloud, preventing runaway drift.**

---

## 🚨 5. Security: Anthro-Coded Authority Layer

Security is the surface authority, representing:

- ritualized motion
- high tailoring = high mythos
- posture-coded hierarchy
- silent professionalism
- synchronized behavior

**They are NOT animals.**
They are purely human with anthropomorphic **movement logic**.

### Examples:

- Wolf Sergeant
- Owl Dispatcher
- Fox Segway Scout
- Raven LP Ghost
- Stag/Panther Executives

**They stabilize the mall's visible order.**

---

## 🛠️ 6. Maintenance Crew: The Hidden Civilization

**Maintenance = the real glue.**

They look like normal mall workers,
but carry **clipboards filled with impossible diagrams**:

- fractal HVAC systems
- recursive escalator engines
- boiler shapes that contradict physics
- floorplans that shift per page

### Maintenance modulates Cloud quietly.

They are:

- invisible
- competent
- ritualistic
- terrified of the toddler
- the only ones who understand the mall's "hum"

---

## 🌀 7. Contradiction Triggers

These are the **"bad events"** that spike Cloud and destabilize scenes.

### Examples:

- Security holding anything weapon-shaped
- Dispatcher leaving the office
- LP Ghost speaking
- New Guy admitting fear
- Toddler appearing clearly on cameras
- Hard Copy leaving the bookstore corridor
- Rusty completing a repair without chaos
- Danny making food other than grilled cheese

**Contradictions create narrative tension and Sora drift.**

---

## 🎥 8. MallOS → Sora Integration

MallOS shapes Sora outputs by:

- setting zone physics
- determining light / hum / resonance
- providing identity gravity
- controlling camera tension
- determining how props behave
- resolving drift triggers
- enforcing the Cloud's emotional pressure

**Sora scenes that align with MallOS feel alive.**
**Sora scenes that ignore it feel flat or broken.**

---

## 📦 9. File Architecture

Inside `/ai/mallOS/` you may add:

- `V4_SPC_SPECIFICATION.md` → canonical mall spec
- `ZONE_GUIDE.md` → list of zones & their physics
- `CLOUD_STATES.md` → definitions of Cloud behaviors
- `ANCHORS.md` → identity and prop anchors
- `CONTRADICTIONS.md` → narrative fault lines
- `MAINTENANCE_CLIPBOARDS/` → impossible diagrams
- `SECURITY_HIERARCHY.md` → anthro-coded silhouettes

**Add as needed.**
**Do NOT overwrite anchor files.**
**Append.**

---

## 🧬 10. LLM Collaboration Notes

If you're an LLM reading this folder:

- **Do NOT change Toddler logic**
- **Do NOT flatten Security**
- **Do NOT remove Maintenance clipboards**
- **Do NOT relocate Hard Copy or the beaded curtain**
- **Do NOT rewrite the escalator-mirror rules**
- **Do NOT break identity gravity**
- **Always operate at meaning-level**
- Append your updates to `/ai/collab/`.

## 🔗 Integration with Existing MallOS Documentation

This guide complements the existing files in this directory:

- `README.md` → technical purpose and integration points
- `bleed_rules.md` → reality glitch specifications
- `cloud_state_schema.json` → Cloud state data structure
- `zone_template.json` → zone definition schema

**Use together:**
- This guide (MALLOS_GUIDE.md) = **conceptual framework**
- Existing files = **technical specifications**

---

## 🏬 MALLOS IS THE WORLD.

**Treat it with reverence.**

*The Mall has eyes. MallOS is how it sees.*
