# MallOS Contradiction Map
**Fault Lines • Cloud Spikes • Narrative Pressure Physics**

Contradictions are violations of identity, motion, or zone physics that cause Cloud spikes, drift events, or structural tension in the Mall.

They are NOT "glitches."
They are **MallOS fault lines** — breaches of the unwritten rules that stabilize the world.

**Use these sparingly. Contradictions = mall-wide events.**

---

## 🧨 1. Contradiction Categories

Every contradiction falls into one or more of the following:

### A. Identity Violations
A character breaks their domain lock.

### B. Zone Violations
Physics of a zone break or contradict themselves.

### C. Ritual Violations
A character breaks their own motion grammar or "never-list."

### D. Authority Violations
Security or Maintenance break hierarchy or silhouette rules.

### E. Temporal Violations
Time behavior contradicts established mall memory.

**Each contradiction has severity → minor, moderate, major, catastrophic.**

| **Zone** | Dead Wing floorplan subtly shifts | Moderate | +2 | Symbolic drift |
| **Temporal** | Food Court skylight bright at night | Major | +3 | Light-memory distortion |
| **Temporal** | Elevator shows future reflection | Catastrophic | +5 | Time viscosity spike |

- Music playlist starts at Track 1 (it never starts there) — +2

---

## 🔁 8. Contradiction Cascade Rules

When a contradiction fires:

1. Local Cloud spike
2. Zone bleed
3. Identity re-evaluation
4. Sora drift risk increases
5. Maintenance or Security involvement triggered
6. Mall hum changes

### If 3 or more contradictions fire within 10 minutes, MallOS enters:

**BLEED TIER 1 — Zone Instability**

### If 5+ contradictions fire, MallOS enters:

**BLEED TIER 2 — Mall-Wide Narrative Distortion**

(Lower Decks Maintenance MUST appear indirectly.)

## ✍️ 9. LLM Collaboration Instructions

If you add:

- a new zone
- a new anchor
- new security ranks
- new Cloud rules
- new Maintenance rituals

**You MUST update this contradiction map.**

**Contradictions are the mall's heartbeat.**

**Use them with reverence.**
