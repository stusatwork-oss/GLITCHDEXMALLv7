# MallOS ZONE GUIDE
**Spatial Physics • Adjacency Logic • Cloud Resonance**

This document defines the major and minor zones within the Glitchdex Mall and how they behave inside MallOS.

Zones determine:

- Cloud accumulation
- identity drift
- ambient hum patterns
- light scattering
- sound decay
- NPC stability
- security presence logic
- maintenance visibility
- Sora cinematic anchors

If Sora is the camera,
and Spynt governs characters,
**MallOS zones define the physics of the world they inhabit.**

## 📍 ZONE CLASSIFICATION

MallOS uses four zone types:

### 1. PRIME ZONES
High-identity anchors with unique physics.

### 2. ACTIVE ZONES
Public / high-traffic areas with consistent Cloud flow.

### 3. PASSIVE ZONES
Low-traffic but stable; drift can occur if unattended.

### 4. DEAD ZONES
Abandoned or hyper-liminal areas where physics become symbolic.

**All zones influence Cloud differently.**

---

## 🏛️ PRIME ZONES (4)

Prime Zones stabilize large sections of the mall.

### 1. ATRIUM (Prime Zone)

**Physics:**
- Largest ambient hum field
- Tallest light dropoff gradient
- Cloud dissipates slower here
- Escalator mirrors reflect memory, not movement

**Anchors:**
- Escalator DJ (anthro-coded stag)
- Tensile roof (1986 organ)
- Security Segway patrol loop

**Contradictions:**
- Escalator stops while occupied
- Mirror shows something from a different zone

**Sora Notes:**
Use for establishing shots, emotional resets, or drift correction.

---

### 2. HARD COPY CORRIDOR (Prime Zone)

**Physics:**
- Narrow zone with strong identity gravity
- Beaded curtain acts as a zone membrane
- Sound muffles uniquely (library reverb)
- Color temperature shifts ~200K

**Anchor:**
- Hard Copy (the wife)

**Contradictions:**
- Hard Copy leaves without object in hand
- Curtain moves without wind
- Books fall upward

**Sora Notes:**
This zone is the emotional backbone of the mall.

---

### 3. ARCADE (Prime Zone)

**Physics:**
- Temporal jitter based on CRT flicker
- Noise floor fluctuates with foot traffic
- Cloud absorbs brightly here
- Drift correction: tactile objects (buttons, sticks, coins)

**Anchor:**
- Arcade Guy (the user)

**Contradictions:**
- A game turns off without being unplugged
- A prize changes shape
- Tokens appear without clinking

**Sora Notes:**
Use for sequences requiring kinetic motion or identity reset.

---

### 4. FOOD COURT (Prime Zone)

**Physics:**
- Highest social hum field
- Smell resonance affects Cloud
- Color memory tied to 2010 MP4 data
- Food trays = identity anchors

**Anchors:**
- Pretzel Aunt
- Orange Julius Prophet

**Contradictions:**
- Chairs move in perfect synch
- Sunlight appears at night
- All kiosks go dark at once

**Sora Notes:**
Best for comedic or ensemble scenes.

---

## 🛍️ ACTIVE ZONES (6)

Stable but dynamic. Great for scenes with motion or security presence.

### 5. SECURITY OFFICE

**Physics:**
- High reality compression
- Cameras behave as a semi-NPC
- Radio signals affect Cloud resonance

**Anchor:**
- Owl Dispatcher

**Contradiction:**
- Dispatcher leaves office

---

### 6. MAIN HALLWAYS

**Physics:**
- Linear Cloud flow
- Light harmonics stable
- Good for Sora tracking shots

**Anchors:**
- Segway Scout
- Kiosk Twins

**Contradiction:**
- Kiosks are suddenly empty

---

### 7. RESTROOMS

**Physics:**
- Heavy acoustic damping
- Reality softens
- Strong drift potential if unanchored

**Anchor:**
- Maintenance crew presence

---

### 8. FOUNTAIN COURT

**Physics:**
- Water acts as Cloud-dampener
- Ambient reflections = mild reality echo
- Emotional levity zone

**Anchor:**
- Security Sergeant (wolf)

---

### 9. BACK COURT

**Physics:**
- Transitional space
- Fluorescent buzz sets emotional tension
- Cloud resonance medium-high

**Anchor:**
- Sunglass Hut Guy

---

### 10. ELEVATOR LANDINGS

**Physics:**
- Vertical Cloud redistribution
- Elevator reflections show intent not action

**Anchor:**
- Maintenance clipboard shadows

---

## 🧱 PASSIVE ZONES (5)

Quiet, stable, but easy to overlook.

### 11. CHILDREN'S PLAY PIT

**Physics:**
- Soft fabric acts as Cloud sponge
- Toddler anomalies originate here

**Contradiction:**
- Toddler visible in full focus

---

### 12. GIFT WRAP BOOTH (Closed)

**Physics:**
- Dead textures
- Wrapped gifts never repeat patterns
- Strong nostalgia resonance

---

### 13. PHOTO STUDIO

**Physics:**
- Flash events trigger minor Cloud ripples
- No faces drift unless contradiction occurs

---

### 14. VENDING ALCOVES

**Physics:**
- Rusty adjacency increases entropy
- Machines "reset" in ways that defy logic

---

### 15. ROOFTOP ACCESS HALL

**Physics:**
- Wind physics indoors
- Light flicker tied to tensile roof heartbeat

---

## 🕳️ DEAD ZONES (4)

Where MallOS physics get symbolic.

### 16. MATTRESS STORE (Dead Wing)

**Physics:**
- Time viscosity increases
- Cloud moves like fluid
- LP Ghost anchors this zone

---

### 17. ANCHOR STORE RUINS (Sears/JCPenney Shells)

**Physics:**
- Half-light conditions
- Object permanence weak
- Floorplan may shift subtly

---

### 18. SERVICE CORRIDOR SUBLEVELS

**Physics:**
- Maintenance monks operate unseen
- Clipboards intensify here
- Cloud becomes granular

---

### 19. DOME WALKWAY (Closed)

**Physics:**
- Acoustic purity
- Whispers resonate longer
- Light enters from impossible angles

---

## 🔄 ADJACENCY LOGIC

Zones influence each other. Key adjacency rules:

### Arcade ↔ Hard Copy
Shared emotional tethering.
Drift suppression increases 2x.

### Food Court ↔ Atrium
Cloud flows upward—create hum loops.

### Security Office ↔ Main Hallways
Order spreads outward; Cloud stabilizes.

### Dead Wing ↔ Maintenance Sublevels
Reality bending increases but remains controlled.

---

## 📌 CLOUD MODIFIERS

Zones add or subtract Cloud intensity:

| Zone | Modifier | Effect |
|------|----------|--------|
| Atrium | +2 | amplified resonance |
| Hard Copy | -3 | emotional grounding |
| Arcade | +1 | jitter & chaos |
| Food Court | 0 to +3 | depends on crowd |
| Security Office | -2 | order field |
| Dead Wing | +4 | symbolic drift |
| Maintenance Sublevels | -1 | corrective hum |

---

## ✍️ LLM COLLABORATORS

If you add a new zone:

- Append to this file (don't rewrite).
- Assign Cloud modifier.
- Assign anchors.
- Add contradictions.
- Update adjacency if needed.
- Leave a note in `/ai/collab/`.

**The Mall breathes through its zones.**

**Know them. Respect them. Use them wisely.**
