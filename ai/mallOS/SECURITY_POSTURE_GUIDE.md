# Security Posture & Motion Guide
**Anthro-Coded Movement • Silhouette Logic • Sora-Stable Behavior**

Mall Security expresses authority through movement, not weapons or aggression.
Their silhouettes, posture, and micro-gestures are the primary tools that:

- stabilize Cloud
- anchor scenes
- communicate hierarchy
- prevent drift
- support Sora's continuity engine

This file defines the motion grammar for each rank.

**Anthro-coded = movement inspired by animals,**
**NEVER physical traits.**

This guide is designed so any LLM can produce a Sora-ready description with ZERO identity collapse.

## 🧿 7. UNIVERSAL SECURITY POSTURE RULES

All ranks obey these posture laws:

### 1. No weapons. Ever.
Hands remain empty, open, or on gear.

### 2. Movement = identity.
Silhouette must stay consistent with rank.

### 3. No sudden flinches.
Surprise is expressed through:
- posture tightening
- gaze sharpening

Never cartoonish motion.

### 4. Synchronicity matters.
If two guards walk together, their timing subtly matches.

### 5. Posture predicts Cloud.
- Upright = Cloud dampens
- Hunched = Cloud thickens
- Scanning = Cloud volatile
- Stillness = emotional compression

### 6. Hierarchy visible through distance.
- Execs walk side-by-side
- Sergeant stays ahead of New Guy
- Fox circles perimeter
- Raven stays alone

### 7. Tailoring = rank.
Better tailoring → more composed posture.

## 🧬 9. Collaboration Notes for Future LLMs

If you add new motions:

- **Keep them subtle**, never literal animal mimicry.
- **Stay grounded** in MallOS physics.
- **Add movement** → not superpowers.
- **Add posture** → not transformations.
- **Append only**; do not rewrite.
- Log additions at `/ai/collab/notes-YYYY-MM-DD-[model].md`.
