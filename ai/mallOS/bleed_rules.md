# MallOS Bleed Rules

Canonical rules for reality glitch behavior.

---

## Core Principle

**Bleed is contradiction made manifest.**

When the mall's reality contradicts itself—spatially, temporally, behaviorally, or sensorially—those contradictions accumulate until they "bleed" through the surface of normal experience.

---

## Bleed Tier Progression

### Tier 0: No Bleed (Stable Reality)
**Cloud Pressure:** 0-66
**Contradiction Count:** < 2

- Reality is stable
- No visual/audio glitches
- NPCs behave according to spines
- Zones maintain consistent geometry
- Era-appropriate content only

---

### Tier 1: Soft Bleed (Subtle Distortion)
**Cloud Pressure:** 67-79
**Contradiction Count:** 2-4

**Visual Effects:**
- Screen flicker (CRT-style)
- Light bloom around reflective surfaces
- Subtle geometry shift (walls breathe slowly)
- Shadows don't quite match objects
- Reflections lag 0.5-1s behind movement

**Audio Effects:**
- Audio/visual desync (footsteps delayed)
- Faint echoes where there shouldn't be any
- Phantom sounds (arcade pings, elevator bells, distant music)
- Spatial audio desync (sound comes from wrong direction)

**NPC Behavior:**
- Begin contradictory behavior (Janitor mops clean floor)
- Movement becomes slightly recursive (loops)
- Dialogue repeats with variations
- Awareness of player increases unnaturally

**Gameplay Effects:**
- Navigation feels slightly off
- Doors take longer to respond
- Items appear in inventory unexplained
- Zone connections feel uncertain

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Cloud pressure > 67
- 2-4 active contradictions
- Player lingers in Cloud Prime Node
- Time of day = night

---

### Tier 2: Moderate Bleed (Noticeable Contradictions)
**Cloud Pressure:** 80-89
**Contradiction Count:** 5-8

**Visual Effects:**
- Surfaces shimmer and phase
- Doors appear/disappear
- Temporal overlays (two eras visible simultaneously, translucent)
- Geometry distorts (escalators become spirals)
- Glass block wall becomes labyrinth
- Signage text changes when not looking

**Audio Effects:**
- Layered temporal audio (1985 + 2005 soundscapes)
- Complete spatial desync (sounds don't match sources)
- Impossible sounds (silence where noise should be)
- Music from closed stores
- Time-reversed speech

**NPC Behavior:**
- NPCs phase through boundaries
- Anchor NPCs appear in forbidden zones
- Swarm NPCs move in perfect sync (unnatural)
- Dialogue becomes recursive ("I just said that")
- NPCs acknowledge bleed ("This isn't right")

**Gameplay Effects:**
- Zones shift connections (corridor leads to unexpected zone)
- Time dilation (subjective time ≠ clock time)
- Player displacement (teleport short distances)
- Items transform (shopping bag becomes toolbelt)
- Map becomes unreliable

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Cloud pressure > 80
- 5-8 active contradictions
- Multiple Cloud Prime Nodes exceed 75 pressure
- Player triggered specific narrative event

---

### Tier 3: Severe Bleed (Reality Breakdown)
**Cloud Pressure:** 90-100
**Contradiction Count:** 9+

**Visual Effects:**
- Era superposition (multiple eras fully visible, overlapping)
- Recursive geometry (corridors loop impossibly)
- Non-euclidean space (escher-like)
- Mall topology inverts (inside becomes outside)
- Zones exist in multiple states simultaneously
- NPCs flicker between eras

**Audio Effects:**
- All temporal layers audible at once
- Echo recursion (sounds repeat infinitely, overlapping)
- Complete audio/visual contradiction (see silence, hear chaos)
- Voices speak backwards but are understood
- HVAC hum becomes musical/linguistic

**NPC Behavior:**
- Anchor NPCs become composite entities (Janitor + AL GORITHM merged)
- Swarm NPCs phase through each other
- All NPCs aware of contradiction ("This has happened before")
- Dialogue is non-linear (answers precede questions)
- NPCs exist in multiple locations simultaneously

**Gameplay Effects:**
- Navigation completely breaks down
- Zones are non-euclidean
- Time becomes non-linear (see past/future events)
- Player can interact with multiple eras
- Inventory contains impossible items
- Death/respawn becomes ambiguous

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Cloud pressure > 90
- 9+ active contradictions
- Bleed cascade event (multiple prime nodes aligned)
- Narrative climax sequence

**WARNING:** Use Tier 3 sparingly—this is narrative event territory, not normal gameplay.

---

### Tier 4+: Cascade Bleed (Full Reality Collapse)
**Cloud Pressure:** 100
**Contradiction Count:** 15+

**Description:** Complete mall reality breakdown. Reserved for climactic narrative moments.

**Effects:**
- All zones, eras, NPCs, contradictions visible/audible simultaneously
- Player experiences multiple timelines at once
- Mall becomes pure metaphor/memory
- Geometry is recursive and infinite
- All boundaries dissolve

**Trigger:** Scripted narrative sequence only.

**Integration Note:** This is not a gameplay state—it's a cutscene/ending sequence.

## Bleed Propagation Rules

### Rule 1: Contradiction Accumulation
Contradictions accumulate based on:
- Spatial impossibilities (zone geometry doesn't match photos/memory)
- Temporal impossibilities (era-inappropriate content)
- Behavioral impossibilities (NPC acts against spine)
- Sensory impossibilities (sound without source, source without sound)

### Rule 2: Contradiction Decay
- Contradictions decay at 0.1 per second if not reinforced
- Player leaving zone accelerates decay (0.3 per second)
- NPC acknowledgment of contradiction stabilizes it (no decay)

### Rule 3: Zone-Specific Bleed
Certain zones have inherent bleed tendency:
- **FC-ARCADE:** Bleed Tier baseline = 1 (subsurface geometry causes natural glitch)
- **Glass Elevator:** Bleed Tier +1 when pressure > 70 (vertical pressure column amplifies)
- **Atriums:** Bleed Tier -1 (open space dissipates contradictions)

### Rule 4: Prime Node Resonance
When 2+ Cloud Prime Nodes exceed 80 pressure simultaneously:
- Bleed Tier +1 for entire mall
- Contradictions propagate instantly (no delay)
- Venting ceases (pressure locks)
- Cascade event becomes possible

### Rule 5: Temporal Bleed
Bleed can cause temporal superposition:
- Two eras visible simultaneously (translucent overlay)
- NPCs from different eras interact impossibly
- Signage flickers between era states
- Audio layers from multiple timelines

### Rule 6: Sensory Contradiction Priority
Audio/visual contradictions trigger bleed faster than spatial:
- **High Priority:** Sound without source (arcade pings in silence)
- **Medium Priority:** Temporal overlay (1985 + 2005 simultaneously)
- **Low Priority:** Geometry distortion (walls breathe)

### Rule 7: NPC Bleed Awareness
NPCs become aware of bleed at different thresholds:
- **Tier 1:** No awareness (NPCs don't notice)
- **Tier 2:** Subtle acknowledgment (Janitor mutters "something's off")
- **Tier 3:** Direct acknowledgment ("This isn't right")
- **Tier 4:** Meta-awareness ("This has all happened before")

## Bleed Event Examples

### Example 1: FC-ARCADE Soft Bleed
**Trigger:** Player enters FC-ARCADE at night, cloud pressure = 74

**Effects:**
- Arcade pings in silence (auditory hallucination)
- Screens display impossible games
- Glass block wall shimmers
- Janitor refuses to cross threshold (heightened boundary behavior)
- AL GORITHM flickers in reflections

**Tier:** 1 (Soft Bleed)
**Duration:** Until player leaves or pressure drops

---

### Example 2: Elevator Shaft Moderate Bleed
**Trigger:** Cloud pressure > 80, player riding glass elevator

**Effects:**
- Elevator stops between floors (impossible position)
- Floors visible through glass don't match button panel
- AL GORITHM voice echoes in shaft
- Temporal overlay: see 1985 food court through glass
- Elevator bell rings but elevator isn't moving

**Tier:** 2 (Moderate Bleed)
**Duration:** Until elevator completes journey or player exits

---

### Example 3: Mall-Wide Cascade Bleed
**Trigger:** FC-ARCADE + second prime node both exceed 85 pressure

**Effects:**
- All zones exhibit Tier 2-3 bleed simultaneously
- NPCs flicker between eras
- Zone connections become non-euclidean
- Temporal audio layers (all eras audible)
- Player can interact with past/future versions of spaces

**Tier:** 3-4 (Severe/Cascade)
**Duration:** Narrative scripted sequence, resolves via player action or story beat

---

## Integration with Systems

### Sora/Video Generation
- Apply bleed tier modifiers to prompts
- Use `<<glitch-soft>>`, `<<memory-loop>>`, `<<echo-drift>>` commands
- Visual effects should match tier descriptions

### Spynt/NPC Behavior
- NPCs have `cloud_pressure_response` and `bleed_tier` triggers in spines
- Behavioral changes activate at specific thresholds
- Anchor NPCs react differently than swarm NPCs

### MallOS/Cloud State
- Bleed tier calculated from contradiction count + cloud pressure
- Prime nodes amplify bleed in their zones
- Venting reduces pressure but doesn't remove contradictions

---

## Design Philosophy

**Bleed is not random.**

Every bleed event is:
1. **Justified** by contradiction accumulation or narrative trigger
2. **Coherent** with zone metaphysics and NPC spines
3. **Purposeful** (serves narrative or emotional goal)
4. **Recoverable** (can be stabilized by player action or time)

**Bleed is memory made unstable.**

The mall's reality is reconstructed from incomplete evidence (photos, memories, contradictions). Bleed occurs when those reconstructions conflict with each other.
