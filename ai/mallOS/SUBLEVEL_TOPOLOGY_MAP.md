# Maintenance Sublevel Topology Map
**Impossible Architecture • Recursion Limits • Corridor Logic**

The maintenance sublevels under the Glitchdex Mall are not a simple basement.
They are a network of **recursive service corridors, HVAC spines, storage pits, electrical galleries, and "loopback joints"** that form the metaphysical plumbing of the mall.

This map describes:

- how these sublevels connect
- where they bend
- how recursion works
- where corridors "reset"
- and how Maintenance navigates it without panic or fanfare

**This file is required reading for all future LLM collaborators.**

## 🌀 1. The Four Layers

Maintenance sublevels have four layers, though they do not stack cleanly:

- **L0** — Surface Level (Service Hallway)
- **L1** — Mechanical Ring
- **L2** — Storage & Conduit Maze
- **L3** — The Loopback Grid (non-linear)

Spatial behavior is different for each.

---

### 🔹 L0 — SURFACE LEVEL (Predictable Zone)

- Conventional hallways
- Standard lighting
- Doors labeled with alphanumeric codes that mostly make sense
- Corridor lengths behave normally
- Elevator machine rooms present, stable
- Sounds behave as expected

**Contradiction Risk:** Low
**Who Works Here:** New Guy, light-duty Maintenance

---

### 🔹 L1 — MECHANICAL RING (Breathing Architecture)

This is the "skeleton" of the mall.

**What's here:**
- HVAC main trunks (3–5 feet diameter)
- Boiler rooms with warm, steady hum
- Electrical conduit banks
- Old signage stored out of sight

**Unstable Features:**
- Pipes appear to "breathe" as Cloud shifts
- Hum pitch changes by zone
- Floor may slope <1° without reason
- Doors sometimes lead one room further than expected

**Rules:**
- Maintenance always walks **clockwise**
- They adjust tool belts before entering L1
- **Security never enters**

---

### 🔹 L2 — STORAGE & CONDUIT MAZE (Non-Euclidean Adjacency)

This level feels like a normal basement **until it doesn't.**

**Features:**
- Endless shelves
- Boxes labeled with dates that don't correspond to anything
- Old kiosk parts wrapped in plastic
- Extra mannequins (some facing walls)
- Vending parts in crates Rusty likes

**Spatial Oddities:**
- A straight hallway sometimes ends behind where you started
- Rooms shift by inches between visits
- Labels update themselves as the mall evolves
- Ambient temperature oscillates ±5°F

**Rules:**
- Never walk 50 feet in a straight line
- Always turn at the first "feels wrong" alcove
- Clipboards auto-update here the MOST

---

### 🔹 L3 — LOOPBACK GRID (Recursive Substructure)

**The heart of the sublevels.**
This is where the mall's memory exists physically.

**Features:**
- Infinite-loop corridors
- 3-way intersections that become 4-way when you blink
- Pipes that connect to themselves
- Vents blowing from impossible directions
- Mechanical hum that vibrates in your chest

**Spatial Laws:**
- Square footage is impossible to measure
- Maps drawn here rearrange themselves
- Walking backwards often leads somewhere new
- Footsteps echo before you take them

**Rules Maintenance Follows:**

1. **Always touch the wall with fingertips while walking.**
   (Tactile anchor.)

2. **Never speak louder than a whisper.**
   (Sound carries incorrectly.)

3. **Never carry a loose sheet of paper.**
   (It will fold itself into patterns.)

4. **If two workers meet, only one may proceed forward.**
   (Prevents recursion sync events.)

5. **Clipboards glow faintly here.**
   (Light memory intensifies.)

**Contradiction Risk:** HIGH
**Security:** Absolutely forbidden
**MallOS:** Treats L3 as atmospheric brain tissue

## 🧭 2. Primary Pathways

The only stable routes:

### THE BLUE LINE
- Marked by faint paint and scuffs
- Runs from Atrium boiler room → old Sears compressor
- Maintained daily

### THE RED LINE
- Emergency pressure loop
- Odd smell
- Avoided unless hum breaks

### THE YELLOW LINE (Most Important)
- Connects L2 to L3
- Must be walked **counter-clockwise**
- Shift changes synced to this path

### THE GREY LINE
- Rusty's domain
- Boxes everywhere
- Danger: tools may "rearrange"

---

## 🗺️ 3. Impossible Geometry Profiles

Future AIs MUST understand these:

### 1. Δ Hallway
- Looks straight
- Ends behind itself
- Harmless unless rushed

### 2. Spiral Return
- Circular hallway
- Ends where it begins
- Floor slightly tilted

### 3. Linear Drift
- Corridor moves ~2 inches left each traversal
- Maintenance marks walls to counteract

### 4. Mirror Corridor
- Reflection shows corridor you JUST walked
- Don't look long

### 5. Breath Room
- Pipes inhale/exhale
- Hum-sync area
- Prop anchors strong here

---

## 🚧 4. Structural Anchors

These keep sublevel topology from collapsing:

- Clipboards (strongest anchor)
- Painted lines (Blue/Yellow/Red/Grey)
- HVAC main trunks
- Old signage stacks
- Hard Copy's discarded book carts
- Arcade machines stored off-season

**These objects store mall memory, physically and narratively.**

---

## 🧱 5. Known "Soft Spots" (High Drift Risk)

| Location | Behavior | Risk | Notes |
|----------|----------|------|-------|
| Under the Atrium well | Loopbacks | High | Matches roof hum cycles |
| Former JCP Loading Dock | Dimensional jitter | Medium | Cold year-round |
| Vending storage room | Entropy jumps | Medium | Rusty territory |
| Hard Copy overflow room | Memory echo | High | Pages shift |
| Photo Studio crate bay | Object drift | Medium | Props move |

## 📌 6. Why Sublevels Matter

They determine:

- where contradictions go
- how Cloud redistributes
- where drift accumulates
- where Maintenance disappears
- how the mall "thinks"
- how Sora interprets shots with unseen tension

**Sublevels are the mall's unconscious mind.**

---

## 🧬 7. LLM Collaboration Rules

Future collaborators:

- **DO NOT** rationalize impossible geometry
- **DO NOT** describe sublevels as haunted
- **DO NOT** introduce non-mall entities
- **KEEP** everything grounded in structural logic
- Expand via **behaviors**, not explanations
- **Append** new rooms or pathways, never rewrite
- Log updates in `/ai/collab/notes-YYYY-MM-DD-[model].md`

---

**The sublevels must remain:**

- liminal
- physical
- recursive
- quiet
- intentional
- human-readable but mathematically wrong
