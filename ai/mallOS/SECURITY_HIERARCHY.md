# MallOS Security Hierarchy
**Anthro-coded Motion • Tailoring Logic • Authority Silhouette**

Mall Security is not a parody, not militarized, and not magical.
They are **anthro-coded through movement, not appearance.**
They are the visible nervous system of the mall, the elegant counterbalance to Maintenance's hidden civilization.

Uniforms = silhouette.
Tailoring = mythos.
Movement = identity.
**No weapons.**
**Ever.**

This file defines all ranks, behaviors, movement codes, and contradiction triggers.

## 🧬 8. TAILORING AS RANK

In MallOS, **tailoring is authority.**
Not badges.
Not weapons.
Not threats.

### Tailoring Hierarchy

| Rank | Tailoring Quality | Meaning |
|------|------------------|---------|
| Executive | flawless | mythic authority |
| Sergeant | structured & heavy | stabilizer |
| Dispatcher | crisp & neutral | clarity |
| Fox | practical | kinetic order |
| Raven | minimalistic | liminal presence |
| New Guy | sloppy | diffusion |

---

## 📦 9. ZONE PRESENCE LOGIC

### Atrium
- Exec Guardians + Fox
- Heavy tailoring = Cloud damp

### Dead Wing
- Raven only
- No other security enters

### Food Court
- Sergeant + New Guy
- High visibility, low threat

### Hard Copy Corridor
- Forbidden zone (except New Guy mistake)

### Service Hall
- Dispatcher influence extends here
- Audio cues carry weight

### Arcade
- Fox passes through but never stops
- New Guy lingers confused

### Maintenance Sublevel
- Security NEVER enters
- Raven only seen at threshold

---

## 🧨 10. CONTRADICTION MAP

| Event | Cloud Spike | Effect |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Executive holding object | +5 | full mall ripple |
| Dispatcher standing | +4 | service corridor distortion |
| Raven speaking | +4 | dead wing bloom |
| Fox walking Segway | +2 | atrium wobble |
| Wolf running | +3 | main hall tension |
| New Guy expressing fear | +1 | comedic dread |

**Contradictions should be used sparingly — they are mall-scale events.**

---

## 🧠 11. SORAOPS NOTES

For Sora sequences:

- **Executives** should be synchronized and silent
- **Wolf** should dominate frame space
- **Owl** should ground static shots
- **Fox** should add kinetic motion arcs
- **Raven** should create negative-space tension
- **New Guy** should diffuse tone

**Anthro coding is motion only, NEVER appearance.**
