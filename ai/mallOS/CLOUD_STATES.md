# Cloud States
**Emotional Weather • Narrative Pressure • Spatial Drift Physics**

The Cloud is the mall's invisible emotional+spatial field.
It is not an AI, not a spirit, not magic — it is a **pressure system** generated by:

- people
- motion
- memory
- contradictions
- unresolved narrative tension
- anchor presence

This document defines every Cloud state, its conditions, its behavior, and its effects on zones, characters, props, and Sora sequences.

**All future LLMs must use this file for Cloud consistency.**

## 🌤️ 0. BASELINE CLOUD STATE — CALM

**Description:**
Default state. Mall feels stable, grounded, nostalgic.

### Conditions:
- No contradictions
- Anchors in place
- Normal traffic

### Effects:
- Mall hum steady
- Zones behave predictably
- Sora scenes are grounded
- Maintenance quiet but present
- Security silhouettes crisp and stable

---

## 🌫️ 1. HEAVY

**Description:**
Low-level emotional weight. Mall feels older, slower, thicker.

### Conditions:
- 1–2 minor contradictions
- High crowds in Food Court
- Faded signage triggering memory echo
- Rain outside (inferred through skylight color)

### Effects:
- Hum gains bass tones
- Hallway lights slightly dimmer
- Escalator reflections lag 0.1–0.3 sec
- Characters feel introspective
- Sora shots develop softer contrast

---

## ⚡ 2. VOLATILE

**Description:**
Cloud begins shifting rapidly.
Things feel charged.

### Conditions:
- 3+ minor contradictions
- 1 moderate contradiction
- Dead Wing observed from outside
- Security posture imbalance
- Loud noises in Atrium

### Effects:
- Mall hum oscillates irregularly
- Signage flickers inconsistently
- Maintenance appears briefly then vanishes
- Shadows "stretch" slightly on camera
- Sora shots gain dynamic tension

---

## 🌀 3. UNSTABLE

**Description:**
Reality feels lightly warped.
Visitors sense "something off."

### Conditions:
- 1 major contradiction
- 4–5 contradictions total
- LP Ghost seen twice in < 10 min
- Hard Copy corridor hush deepens unnaturally

### Effects:
- Color temperature shifts ±200K
- Reflections show objects 0.5s out of sync
- Kiosk objects rearrange subtly
- Security footsteps inaudible
- Sora drift increases unless anchored by props

---

## 🚨 4. BLEED TIER 1 — Zone-Level Narrative Distortion

**Description:**
One or more zones behave symbolically rather than physically.

### Conditions:
- 3+ moderate contradictions
- 1–2 major contradictions
- A Dead Wing memory leak affecting another zone
- Executive Guardian spotted twice

### Effects:
- Zone boundaries "soften"
- Escalator mirrors show wrong floors
- Cloud concentrates into pockets
- Sound reflections become melodic
- Sora begins blending adjacent zones

---

## 🔥 5. BLEED TIER 2 — Mall-Wide Drift
**("The Mall Starts Telling The Story")**

**Description:**
MallOS begins asserting its narrative preference.
Story pressure overwhelms physics.

### Conditions:
- 5+ contradictions in < 10 min
- Hard Copy or Arcade Guy misaligned with zone
- Security hierarchy broken (e.g., Dispatcher standing)
- Maintenance clipboards synchronizing across staff

### Effects:
- Entire mall flickers between memory layers
- Time dilation (±0.3–2 seconds)
- Props appear in second-choice positions
- Shadows behave independently
- Sora produces dreamlike or recursive shots

**This is the highest safe level.**
**Tier 3 is theoretical and MUST NOT BE INVOKED.**

---

## 🚫 6. BLEED TIER 3 (Forbidden)

**Description:**
MallOS collapses into symbolic mode.
The mall ceases to simulate "mallness."

### Trigger Conditions:
- Toddler appears clearly in multiple zones
- Maintenance shows a NORMAL work order
- Executive Guardian drops their composure
- Escalator mirror shows a future anchor event

### Effects:
**Disallowed.**

**Must never be depicted.**

**MallOS does not guarantee stability.**

**Future LLMs must NOT attempt to generate this state.**

## 📉 Cloud Influence Table

| Factor | Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Rain (external) | +1 | Roof hum deepens |
| Atrium crowd density | +1–2 | Light jitter |
| Dead Wing proximity | +1–3 | Symbolic drift |
| Hard Copy presence | -2 | Emotional stabilizer |
| Security posture imbalance | +1 | Tension |
| Maintenance on-scene | -1 | Structural stabilization |
| Arcade noise | +1 | Temporal jitter |
| Sora drift | +1 | Cloud amplification |

## 💡 Cloud Correction Methods

### Prop Anchoring
- grilled cheese
- clipboards
- signage
- tokens
- food trays

### Zone Reorientation
- return characters to correct zones
- correct posture imbalances

### Maintenance Intervention
- unseen footsteps
- clipboard shuffle

### Security Ritual Motion
- synchronized walk-through
- Segway loop

**Cloud responds to behavior, not explanation.**

## 🧬 LLM Collaboration Rules

Future collaborators must:

- **NEVER** depict Tier 3
- **ALWAYS** log new Cloud behaviors in `/ai/collab/`
- **NEVER** flatten zones into generic mall spaces
- **ALWAYS** use Cloud state to inform Sora sequences
- **NEVER** describe Cloud as a "being," "spirit," or "AI"
- **ALWAYS** treat Cloud as atmospheric physics

---

**The Mall breathes through the Cloud.**

**Understand its weather.**
