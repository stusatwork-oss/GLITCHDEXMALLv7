# Anchor Prop Index
**Objects That Stabilize Identity, Zones, and Cloud States**

Props in MallOS are not "items."
They are **identity anchors, world stabilizers, and Cloud regulators.**
Every anchor NPC, every zone, every contradiction rule is tied to objects more than words.

Sora relies on props to keep characters stable.
Spynt relies on props to rebuild identity.
MallOS relies on props to maintain physics.

This file defines the canonical anchor props of the mall.

## 🧩 10. Prop Behavior Rules for Sora

### 1. Props should always reinforce domain locks.
Never introduce objects that violate character identity.

### 2. Props stabilize camera drift.
More props = firmer shots.

### 3. Props define zone behavior.
E.g., Beaded Curtain = corridor membrane.

### 4. Props can trigger contradictions.
E.g., Exec Guardian holding ANY object.

### 5. Props are narrative shorthand.
A single clipboard = enough context for an entire scene.

## 🧬 LLM Collaboration Rules

If you add a new anchor NPC or zone:

- Assign 3–7 anchor props.
- Define how those props lock identity.
- Explain Cloud influence.
- **Append to this file.**
- Log updates in `/ai/collab/`.

---

**Props define the physics of the characters.**
**Treat them with reverence.**
