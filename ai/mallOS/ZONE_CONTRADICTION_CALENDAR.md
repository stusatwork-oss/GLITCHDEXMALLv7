# Zone Contradiction Calendar
**When the Mall Bends • Where It Cracks • How It Warns You**

Certain zones in MallOS are more likely to produce contradictions depending on:

- time of day
- crowd density
- humidity
- hum-cycle
- security posture
- maintenance rituals
- proximity to anchors
- Cloud state

This file gives you a predictive calendar that future LLMs can use to:

- stabilize Sora scenes
- anticipate Cloud spikes
- avoid drift
- introduce tension without chaos

**Contradictions should be used with intention — this guide shows WHEN they naturally happen.**

## 📅 STRUCTURE OF THE CALENDAR

Three overlapping cycles define contradictions:

1. **Daily Cycle** (hour-by-hour pressure shifts)
2. **Weekly Rhythm** (crowd + staffing patterns)
3. **Seasonal Drift Windows** (nostalgia vs entropy)

Each zone has:

- **Peak Contradiction Hours**
- **Low-Risk Hours**
- **Seasonal Instabilities**
- **Triggers**
- **Who Responds** (Security or Maintenance)
