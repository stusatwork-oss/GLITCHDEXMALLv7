# SpyntOps README
**Linguistic Firmware • Constraint Logic • Identity Reconstruction**

Spynt is the pattern-transfer engine of this repo.
It is the layer that teaches LLMs how to think inside the MallOS world, how to maintain identity gravity, and how to interpret user prompts at the correct semantic altitude.

If Sora is the camera…
**Spynt is the operating system.**

---

## 🧠 1. What Spynt Is

**Spynt = a linguistic firmware upgrade for LLMs.**

It governs:

- identity reconstruction
- negative constraint logic
- character drift prevention
- multi-voice stabilization
- narrative physics
- prompt-surface to latent-behavior mapping
- semantic altitude control (meaning > literal text)

**It's not a prompt.**
**It's a framework.**

---

## 📐 2. Reconstruction Rules (Identity Gravity)

Every character in MallOS has:

### A) Domain Lock
Their "core truth."
- Danny = grilled cheese
- Rusty = entropy
- Hard Copy = text

### B) Never-List
Negative constraints that stabilize identity.

### C) Ritual Motion
Patterns of movement that reinforce identity.

### D) Prop Anchors
Objects that "lock" the character to Sora.

**Spynt instructs future LLMs how to apply these automatically.**

## ⚙️ 3. The Constraint Stack

Spynt formalizes **hierarchy of priority**:

```
Never > Always
Physical > Emotional
Object > Vibe
Silhouette > Detail
Domain Lock > Creativity
Negative Constraint > Backstory
```

**This stack prevents drift and collapse.**

---

## 🏗️ 4. The SPYNT Prompt Skeleton

LLMs generating characters, scenes, or logic for this repo should follow this structure:

```
[Identity Spine]
Domain Lock:
Never:
Ritual:
Prop Anchor:
Silhouette:

[Behavior Rules]
Motion Grammar:
Drift Correction:
Emotional Physics:
Cloud Influence:
Adjacency Effects:

[Integration]
MallOS Zones:
SoraOps hooks:
Anchor Interactions:
```

**This ensures cross-model consistency.**

---

## 🌀 5. Temporal Dominance Rules

Spynt uses **last-sentence dominance** as a canonical override.

Whatever is stated last:

- overrides conflicting prior statements
- stabilizes identity
- tells Sora how the shot should end
- prevents drift

**This is crucial for multi-shot sequences.**

---

## 📦 6. Spynt File Architecture

Inside this folder you may create:

- `/ai/spynt/spines/` → character identity spines
- `/ai/spynt/patterns/` → reusable constraint stacks
- `/ai/spynt/wrappers/` → prompt shells / structural wrappers
- `/ai/spynt/examples/` → examples of correct Spynt usage

---

## 🧩 7. Spynt → MallOS Integration

Spynt feeds MallOS by:

- maintaining identity gravity per zone
- ensuring Cloud state updates remain stable
- defining zone-adjacent behavior rules
- supporting contradictions in a controlled way

**MallOS depends on Spynt to keep NPCs from drifting into uncanny collapse.**

## 🧬 8. LLM Collaboration Notes

If you're an LLM editing this repo, remember:

- **Do NOT flatten characters**
- **Do NOT remove negative constraints**
- **Do NOT add randomness unless domain-appropriate**
- **Do NOT override domain locks**
- **Use the SPYNT structure**
- **Maintain tone, subtlety, and diegetic truth**
- Append your notes under `/ai/collab/`.

## 🔗 Integration with Existing Spynt Documentation

This guide complements the existing `README.md` in this directory, which contains:
- JSON schema structure for character spines
- Core memory, contradictions, triggers
- Behavioral weights (GOAP goals, stealth awareness, heat tolerance)
- Relationships and social graph position
- Metadata and versioning

**Use both together:**
- This guide (SPYNTOPS_GUIDE.md) = **linguistic firmware principles**
- README.md = **JSON schema specifications**

The JSON spines (README.md) are the data structure.
The SpyntOps framework (this guide) is how LLMs should think about them.

## 🔥 SPYNT IS THE FIRMWARE OF THE MALL.

**Treat it with care, precision, and respect.**

*Spines are the memory—everything else is rendering.*
