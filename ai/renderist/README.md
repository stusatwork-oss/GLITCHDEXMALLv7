# Renderist - Metaphysics & Lore

Codex fragments, philosophical framework, and canonical mythology.

## Purpose

The Renderist directory contains the metaphysical and narrative framework that governs how reality, contradiction, and canon function in GLUTCHDEXMALL.

## Core Concepts

### Canon Emergence
> "Canon emerges from resonance and repetition, not ego."

- Contradictions don't "break" canon—they reveal it
- Multiple timeline layers coexist (1981, 1995, 2005, 2011)
- Reality is reconstructed, not simulated
- The mall remembers even when it shouldn't

### The Cloud
- Global pressure system (0-100)
- Four moods: tension, wander, surge, bleed
- Three bleed tiers: shifts, drifts, tears
- Witness-dependent: rises when observed contradictions accumulate

### Contradiction Mechanics
- **Trigger**: Anchor NPC experiences incompatible memories
- **Propagation**: Cloud pressure increases, mood shifts
- **Cascade**: Zone cooldown begins, bleed event fires
- **Resolution**: Cooldown expires, new layer settles

### Architectural Scale
> "Space station with a parking lot, not a building."

- Civic-scale interior (~1M+ sq ft)
- Tensile sail roof technology (pioneered by KKT early 80s)
- Mast heights: 60-80+ feet (not 35 feet!)
- Atrium diameter: 150-200+ feet (not 60-80 feet!)

## Integration

Renderist documents inform:
- `ai/mallOS/` simulation rules
- `ai/spynt/` character motivations
- `ai/sora/` visual tone and atmosphere
- `v6-nextgen/canon/` canonical entity definitions

## Tone

Renderist documents blend:
- Serious architectural analysis
- Playful metaphysical speculation
- Precise technical constraints
- Poetic reconstruction philosophy

**Core technical facts remain clear.** Mythology augments, never obscures.

## Key Fragments

### On Scale
"The mall is not a building you walk through in 5 minutes. It's a place you get *lost* in. The atrium isn't cozy—it's vast. The roof isn't low—it soars. Escalators don't gently slope—they *drop* two stories into the sunken court."

### On Time
"The mall exists in all eras simultaneously. 1981 is not 'the past'—it's a layer. 2011 is not 'the end'—it's a surface. The Cloud holds all versions, and contradiction is how you move between them."

### On Canon
"If three photos show the fountain at different heights, all three are true. The fountain changed. Or reality did. Or you did. The Cloud doesn't care which."
