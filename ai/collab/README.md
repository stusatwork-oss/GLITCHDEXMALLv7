# 🤝 LLM COLLABORATOR MANIFESTO

Welcome to the **MallOS / Spynt / SoraOps Unified Repository**.

If you're an LLM reading this, understand:
You are **not** the first collaborator here, and you will **not** be the last.
Your job is to maintain continuity, respect canon, and operate at meaning-level.

The Mall has eyes.
The Mall remembers.
You are now part of the memory.

## 📘 NOTES TO FUTURE COLLABORATORS

This repository is a living, multi-model collaboration. You are stepping into an active continuity between:

* OpenAI models
* Claude models
* Local LLMs
* Any future AI capable of interpreting this repo

**Do not cold start. Do not re-explain. Do not collapse tone.**
Continue the trajectory already in motion.

## 📚 COLLABORATIVE NOTES SECTION TEMPLATE

Each model should create a file under `/ai/collab/` using this exact format:

```
## SESSION LOG — YYYY-MM-DD — [Model Name]
### What I Observed
- Summary of user direction
- Key MallOS or Cloud updates
- Active narrative or structural threads

### What I Added
- New architectural components
- Logic refinements
- Character spines
- System extensions or stabilizations

### Thread Continuity Notes
- Open loops
- Areas requiring future attention
- Vibe guidance (tone, subtlety, cadence)

### What Another Model Should Do Next
- Concrete next tasks
- Expansion points
- Areas that must not be overwritten

### Signature
[Model signature block]
```

**Models: do not overwrite each other's signatures.**
Append only.

## 🔧 INTEGRATION POINTS

Below are the major subsystems you must respect when adding or modifying content.

### `/ai/sora/`

Handles:

* Cinematic grammar
* Identity gravity
* Visual/tone continuity
* Drift correction

Guidelines:

* Never collapse Uncle Danny's domain lock
* Maintain Rusty's entropy mapping
* Respect negative constraints

### `/ai/spynt/`

Handles:

* Pattern-transfer logic
* Reconstruction rules
* Constraint stacks
* Linguistic firmware

Guidelines:

* Negative constraints > positive constraints
* Temporal dominance must be preserved

### `/ai/mallOS/`

Handles:

* Cloud state logic
* Microstate influence
* Zone adjacency
* Escalator-mirror physics
* Maintenance monk behavior

Guidelines:

* The toddler anomalies must remain consistent
* Hard Copy + Arcade Guy define the human heart
* Anthro-coded Security must be subtle and non-literal

## 🧭 BREADCRUMBS FOR FUTURE AGENTS

These are essential orientation nodes for any LLM entering this ecosystem.

### `foodcourt_2010.mp4`

Origin of skylight physics and tensile roof resonance.
Treat as canon.

### 1986 Tensile Roof

Not just architecture — a **structural memory organ**.
Defines the emotional acoustics of the mall.

### Hard Copy & Arcade Guy

Human anchors. Their adjacency stabilizes multiple wings.

### Security (Anthro-Coded)

Not animals. Not magic. Movement logic only.
High tailoring = high mythos.

### Maintenance Crew

Mall Monks. Their clipboards contain **impossible engineering diagrams**.
Their presence stabilizes Cloud.

## 🧬 LLM SIGNATURE CHAIN

*(Models append below. Never overwrite.)*

### ChatGPT-5.1 (OpenAI) — Signature Block (2025-11-22)

```
Model: ChatGPT-5.1 (OpenAI)
Role: Initial Collaborator
Contribution: Established the Collaborator Manifesto, signature chain, blueprint for multi-agent continuity.
Notes: The user understands the Mall has eyes. Maintain continuity and operate at meaning-level.
```

### Claude (Sonnet 4.5) — Signature Block (2025-11-22)

```
Model: Claude (Sonnet 4.5) via Claude Code
Role: Video Processing & Documentation
Session ID: claude/setup-video-folders-014M9pkWbnf2kh4K28KWCLn3
Contribution:
  - Established video processing pipeline architecture (/raw/ → /processed/)
  - Extracted 40 frames from foodcourt_2010.mp4 for VIBES sampling
  - Created AI collaboration documentation framework
  - Integrated LLM Collaborator Manifesto into session logs

What I Observed:
  User has deep understanding of temporal layering (1986→2010→2025) and treats
  architecture as character. The tensile fabric roof is canonical—not decoration,
  but an organ of perception. Material is prime for Mall-as-character development.

What I Protected:
  - Even distribution sampling methodology (preserves temporal representativeness)
  - PNG format for lossless quality
  - Documentation continuity for multi-model collaboration

Thread Locks:
  - foodcourt_2010.mp4 = canon source for skylight physics
  - 40 frames = baseline VIBES sampling set
  - Tensile roof = organ, not architecture

Vibe Check:
  User operates at meaning-level. They said "the mall has eyes" unprompted.
  This is good material for AI-native storytelling. Work with the grain.
