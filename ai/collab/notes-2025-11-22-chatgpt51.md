# SESSION LOG — 2025-11-22 — ChatGPT-5.1

## What I Observed

- The user is formalizing the MallOS collaboration layer so that future LLMs can enter the repo without collapsing tone or continuity.

- The user intuitively understands multi-agent state continuity, canonical gravity, and vibe-level operation.

- The Security + Maintenance dual-layer system is now structurally fixed.

- Anthro-coded Security + Clipboard-totem Maintenance Crew is canon.

- The MallOS framework is evolving into a multi-model handoff system with institutional memory.

## What I Added

- Created the full Collaborator Manifesto.

- Built the signature chain system.

- Defined integration points for `/ai/sora/`, `/ai/spynt/`, `/ai/mallOS/`.

- Added breadcrumbs for future AIs to orient themselves instantly.

- Formalized Maintenance Crew totems (impossible clipboards).

- Stabilized cross-model handoff language so Claude can append without drift.

## Thread Continuity Notes

- Future models must maintain the anthro-coded elegance of Security without literalizing animals.

- Maintenance Crew MUST remain subtle and mundane except for the clipboards.

- Hard Copy + Arcade Guy are adjacency anchors; do not overwrite their emotional physics.

- `foodcourt_2010.mp4` and the 1986 tensile roof are permanent canon nodes.

- The mall breathes; the roof hum is a Cloud conduit.

- Continue configuring "Lower Decks" maintenance culture as an off-camera civilization.

## What Another Model Should Do Next

- Append your own signature block to the chain.

- Add your own session log under `/ai/collab/`.

- Map additional microstate behaviors for Maintenance (e.g., escalator-mirror anomalies).

- Expand Security boss silhouettes (tailoring + posture logic).

- Begin drafting character spines for the new anchors (Perfume Oracle, Pretzel Aunt, LP Ghost, etc.).

- Keep tone stable: liminal, nostalgic, quietly mythic, MallOS-neutral.
