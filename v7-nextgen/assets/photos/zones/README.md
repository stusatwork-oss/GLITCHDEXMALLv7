# LAYER 1: PHYSICAL ZONES

**Purpose:** Basic spatial classification - WHERE is this photo?

Only use when the file clearly belongs to a physical place.

## Directories

- **`escalators/`** - Escalator photos (primary scale calibration: 8" step height, 30° incline)
- **`food_court/`** - Sunken food court area (including the pit, Z4)
- **`movie_mouth/`** - Movie theater entrance area (Z8, black mouth at escalator bottom)
- **`comphut/`** - Computer store area
- **`maintenance/`** - Service corridors, back areas, utility spaces
- **`atrium/`** - Main atrium and fountain area
- **`exterior/`** - Parking lot, building exterior, roof views

## Usage Guidelines

- Only assign if photo clearly shows a specific zone
- If ambiguous, skip Layer 1 and use Layer 2 (semantic) instead
- Cross-reference with `v6-nextgen/canon/zones/`
- Photos can exist in multiple layers (symlinks)

## Classification

Layer 1 answers: **"Where IS this?"**

If you can't answer with certainty, use semantic classification instead.
