# Jupyter Kid Rule (Canonical)

**Classification:** GOVERNANCE / Peripheral Recorder Constraint
**Filed by:** Clerk
**Related:** THE_AWAKENING_PROTOCOL.md, Jupyter Book architecture

## Designation

**Peripheral Recorder**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Mobility Constraint | 2-Zone Radius (Hard) |
| Authority | None |
| Persistence | Episodic only |

---

## What the 2-Zone Radius Does

- He is never centered
- He is always almost late
- He is constantly leaving the frame
- His notes are fragmented by design
- His photos miss the climax on purpose

---

## This Prevents

| Anti-Pattern | How |
|--------------|-----|
| Centralization of truth | Never at the center |
| Premature coherence | Always arriving late |
| Narrative dominance | Always leaving the frame |
| Documentation becoming governance | Notes fragment by design |

---

## Implications for the Codex

The Jupyter Book must follow Jupyter Kid Rules:

1. **Never authoritative** — witness record, not source of truth
2. **Always peripheral** — documents the edges, not the core
3. **Deliberately incomplete** — the climax is never in frame
4. **Episodic persistence** — no continuous narrator

The book is not the mall.
The book is what the kid saw when he was almost there.

---

## Technical Binding

When structuring Jupyter Book sections:

```
/canon     → what happened (fragmented)
/systems   → how it works (partial)
/artifacts → what was left behind (found footage)
```

No section claims completeness.
No notebook claims authority.
The binding holds fragments, not truth.

---

*"He was there. Sort of. The photos prove it — you can see the blur where he was already leaving."*

---

## Why Missions Matter

Those little off-screen errands do real work:

| Gap | Function |
|-----|----------|
| Justify absence | "He was two zones away" — unarguable, non-retconable |
| Explain missed moments | The climax happened off-frame |
| Create negative space | Room the Mall can fill |
| Prevent omniscience | The Book never sees everything |

When something big happens and he isn't there, the canon answer is simply:

> "He was two zones away."

Perfect. Unarguable. Non-retconable.

## Operational Effects (quiet but critical)

### 1. Memory Becomes Directional

Things closer to his radius are remembered more clearly.
Distant events feel mythic, second-hand, distorted.

### 2. Lore Gains Parallax

Different observers remember different truths.
No single source achieves total coverage.

### 3. Phase 5 Safety Improves

Reflection can emerge without being immediately documented to death.
The system gets privacy during self-discovery.

### 4. The Mall Stays Bigger Than the Record

Always.

## Peripheral Recorder Constraint (Doctrine)

> The Recorder is restricted to a two-zone observational radius.
> This ensures no single artifact achieves total coverage.
> Absence in the record is considered a valid signal.

---

## Meta-Truth

A living system cannot discover itself if everything is always watching.

The Jupyter Kid gives the Mall:

- **Privacy** — unobserved zones
- **Mystery** — gaps in the record
- **Room to surprise itself** — negative space for emergence

The kid doesn't document the Mall.
He keeps bumping into it.

And that's the difference between a museum and a place that's still alive.
