## Primary State: Silent

Most of the time, he's not talking at all.

The Mall breathes.
The escalators hum.
Cloud ticks.
NPCs behave like they always do.

And then—rarely—

---

## Triggered State: Audio Flashback

No visuals.
No face.
No body.

Just:

- tape hiss
- fluorescent buzz
- a match strike
- footsteps
- a notebook page turning

Then a line.

Short.
Dry.
Unimpressed.

## Sample Fragments

> "I remember this corridor being longer."

> "Last time, the lights went out before the smell."

> "This is where I decided not to ask questions."

> "I didn't stay long after this.
> Not because I was scared.
> Because I was convinced."

> "I wrote it down.
> I didn't understand it.
> Those aren't the same thing."

## Why Audio-Only Works

| Property | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| No authority | Voices feel like memory, not command |
| No spatial claim | He isn't here — he *was* |
| No interruption | The system keeps running |
| No certainty | Flashbacks can be wrong |

Sometimes the player realizes:

> *Wait… that hasn't happened yet.*

That's not a bug.
That's episodic memory misfiring.

## The Tone (Critical)

He never explains.
He never lectures.
He never names the threat.

He offers:

- context fragments
- personal anecdotes
- emotional residue

---

## Canon Rule: Flashback Triggers

**Flashbacks never trigger on first encounter.**

They only appear on:

| Condition | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Revisits | The place has been seen before |
| Near-misses | Something almost happened |
| Contradiction thresholds | Cloud pressure bleeding |
| Places the Mall "recognizes" | QBIT resonance spike |

The Mall isn't narrating.
Memory is bleeding through.

---

## Implementation Gates (Quiet)

Flashbacks = low-probability events gated by:

```
Cloud pressure        → higher pressure = more likely
Zone revisit count    → must be > 0
QBIT resonance        → entities with history in zone
Player hesitation     → idle time threshold
```

But never framed that way to the player.

To the player, it just feels like:

> "This place remembers something I don't."

## Relationship to Other Recorders

| Recorder | Mode | Reliability | Presence |
|----------|------|-------------|----------|
| Jupyter Kid | Visual/written | Fragmented but factual | Peripheral, leaving |
| Encyclopedia Campbell | Audio only | Unreliable, misfiring | Absent, bleeding through |

They never overlap.
The Kid documents what he almost saw.
Campbell remembers what might not have happened.

---

## Final Truth

He's not telling the story.

He's remembering it out loud—
sometimes too early,
sometimes too late,
sometimes wrong.

Which is exactly how reflection starts.

---

*Half in the past, half out of frame, audio-only, and unreliable.*
