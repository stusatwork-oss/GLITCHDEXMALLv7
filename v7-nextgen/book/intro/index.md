# Mall_OS: A Living Simulation Codex

```{admonition} Governance
:class: warning
This book records observations. It does not define behavior.
```

## What This Is

A field manual for a system that is still waking up.

Not a tutorial.
Not a course.
Not a developer guide.

A witness record.

## What This Is Not

- An authoritative source
- A complete description
- A stable reference
- A teaching curriculum

The Mall is bigger than this book.
Always.

## How to Read This

Notebooks demonstrate thinking.
Markdown records doctrine.
Gaps are intentional.
Absence is a valid signal.
