AI_FILES_SUMMARY.md
(What These AI Files Do & Why They Exist)

This document explains the purpose, behavior, and architectural role of the four AI-oriented meta-files added to the GLUTCHDEXMALL repository.
These files allow GitHub Models, Copilot, and external LLMs to reason consistently, chronologically, and structurally about this project.

🟥 1. AI_INTENT.md
“What AI should try to do in this repo.”

This file acts as the mission statement for all AI assistants interacting with the project.

It defines:

the purpose of the project

the expected mindset an AI should adopt

the architectural scale rules

the CRD workflow

how to think about v1–v6

what to preserve and what to avoid

the Renderist / Cloud worldview

the rule of reconstruction over invention

If the repo were a living system, AI_INTENT.md is the organ that provides direction and values.

Use this file to keep future AIs aligned with the project’s soul.

🟨 2. AI_MEMORY.md
“The permanent facts every AI must remember.”

This file contains the canonical truths of the Eastland Mall reconstruction:

scale

measurements

escalator metrology

atrium geometry

two-level / pit structure

zone logic

version chronology

Renderist doctrine

Cloud behavior

what v3 got wrong

what v5 got right

what v6 must inherit

This is your non-negotiable foundation, the hard constraints that no AI should ever contradict.

If AI_INTENT.md is the project’s soul…
AI_MEMORY.md is its spine.

🟩 3. VERSION_MATRIX.md
“The map of the timeline.”

This file defines:

every version (v1–v6)

the era it belongs to

what it contributed

its status (frozen, corrupted, active, future)

how AI should use it

which versions are authoritative

This prevents:

rewriting history

collapsing versions together

accidentally reinforcing v3’s wrong scale

confusing prototype vs. canonical architecture

losing the museum-logic of the shareware loader

It is the sorting algorithm for the entire repo’s history.

If the repo were a computer, VERSION_MATRIX.md is the directory index.

🟦 4. .github/model-instructions.md
“The file GitHub Models read BEFORE anything else.”

This is the highest-priority context file for GitHub’s new AI model system.

GitHub Models and Copilot read this BEFORE:

your code

your README

your comments

your directory structure

This file tells the AI:

how to behave

what scale to use

which metrology is authoritative

which versions matter

where to write new code

when not to hallucinate

how to apply CRD

how to preserve the shareware bootloader lineage

what style of reasoning to follow

This file controls the entire AI behavior profile for your repo.

If your repo were a spaceship, .github/model-instructions.md is the flight computer.

🟪 How These Files Work Together

Think of the four AI files like a Renderist chipset:

AI_INTENT.md         → WHY the repo exists
AI_MEMORY.md         → WHAT is always true
VERSION_MATRIX.md    → WHEN and WHERE everything belongs
model-instructions   → HOW AI should behave in the repo


When all four are present:

✔ AI becomes consistent
✔ AI becomes version-aware
✔ AI respects scale
✔ AI maintains continuity
✔ AI stops hallucinating geometry
✔ AI understands history
✔ AI assists instead of rewriting
✔ AI becomes a custodian of the project, not an intruder

This is how you build an AI-native megaproject that stays coherent over years.

🟫 Final Notes for Future You

If you ever:

create v7, v8, or v9

refactor zone logic

change scale

add a new engine

introduce a Pit of Trials

export to Unity / Unreal

add modding support

Update ALL FOUR FILES.

They are the neural anchors of the whole architecture.

Treat them like sacred documents.

Renderist law begins here.
