## CONFIRMATION OF FINDINGS (2025-12-19)

**Status:** ✅ **VERIFIED**

A review of `v8-nextgen/NEW-needs_integration/` confirms the analysis above. The files are present and contain the code necessary to bridge the gap between the V7 simulation backend and a playable V8 frontend.

**Action Plan Executed:**
1.  **Documentation Updated:** `AI_INTENT.md` and `v8-nextgen/README.md` now reflect the V8 Lab status.
2.  **Integration Started:** Moving critical files from `NEW-needs_integration` to `src/` to form the functional core of V8.
