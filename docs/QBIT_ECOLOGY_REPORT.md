## Top Anchor NPC Candidate: The Janitor

**Overall Score:** 2786 (highest of all entities)
**Power:** 1478 (structural leverage - high for NPC)
**Charisma:** 1308 (strong narrative pull)
**Rarity:** Common (but approaching Rare threshold at 3600)

### Behavioral Constraints (Spine)
- **Never crosses FC-ARCADE threshold** (spatial constraint)
- **Never speaks about wife** (dialogue constraint)
- **Always faces away from bookstore** (directional constraint)
- **Repetitive mopping pattern** (behavioral anchor)

### QBIT Impact on Gameplay
With power score of 1478, The Janitor can trigger contradictions at Cloud level **70** (vs 75 baseline). This makes him a "rule-breaker authority" - when Cloud pressure reaches 70+, he may violate his "never" rules, creating dramatic contradiction events.

**Example contradiction:** At Cloud 72, Janitor crosses FC-ARCADE threshold for first time, breaking primary spatial constraint.

## Cloud Prime Node Analysis

### Sunken Food Court (Overall: 2278)

**Canonical Designation:** "The Pit of First Noise"

**QBIT Characteristics:**
- Power: 761 (high structural weight from zone volume)
- Charisma: 1517 (highest charisma of all entities)
- Massive resource pool: 100,000,000 (zone physical mass)
- Network reach: 10 (touches all major systems)

**Cloud Pressure Impact:**
- Zone QBIT aggregate: 2278
- Turbulence modifier: +2.28 (vs 0.0 baseline)
- Pressure contribution: 0.46 per update cycle
- Resonance amplification: 1.25x (25% faster memory accumulation)

**Entities in this zone:**
1. Sunken Food Court (zone itself) - 2278
2. Orange Julius Stand - 1530
3. Leisurely Leon - 1154
4. Mirror Maze Token - 1150

**Total FC-ARCADE Influence:** 6112

This makes FC-ARCADE the single strongest narrative attractor in the mall. NPCs using QBIT-weighted pathfinding will preferentially move toward this zone. Bleed events are more likely to spawn here. Player discoveries in this zone gain 1.25x resonance.

## Role Distribution

### Primary Entities (5)
**Average Overall:** 2043.8

| Entity | Type | Overall |
|--------|------|---------|
| The Janitor | NPC | 2786 |
| Sunken Food Court | Zone | 2278 |
| Tensile Roof Mast | Zone | 1963 |
| Al Gorithm | NPC | 1694 |
| Wife (at Bookstore) | NPC | 1498 |

Primary entities are narrative drivers. They have "never" rules that can be broken at high Cloud levels, creating major contradiction events.

### Secondary Entities (4)
**Average Overall:** 1295.5

| Entity | Type | Overall |
|--------|------|---------|
| Orange Julius Stand | Artifact | 1530 |
| Escalator Hum | Anomaly | 1348 |
| Leisurely Leon | Arcade Cabinet | 1154 |
| Mirror Maze Token | Artifact | 1150 |

Secondary entities provide ambient influence and texture. They rarely trigger contradictions but contribute to zone atmosphere and resonance accumulation.

---

## Adjacency Impact Predictions

Based on QBIT-weighted adjacency formula:

### FC-ARCADE as Attractor
With total influence of 6112, FC-ARCADE will have:
- **Gravity pull:** 1.02 (normalized QBIT 10.2/10)
- **Adjacency probability from other zones:** 25-35% (vs 10% baseline)
- **NPC pathfinding bias:** NPCs are 2.5-3.5x more likely to move toward FC-ARCADE

### The Janitor's Movement Pattern
- Home zone: CORRIDOR (influence 2786)
- Allowed zones: CORRIDOR, SERVICE_HALL (4134), ENTRANCE
- Forbidden zone: FC-ARCADE (6112)

**Contradiction scenario:** At Cloud 70+, Janitor can break spatial constraint and enter FC-ARCADE. This creates narrative tension - the highest-influence NPC entering the highest-influence zone. Expected result: Cloud pressure spike (+5-10), potential Bleed Tier escalation.

---

## Cloud Pressure Projections

### Entity Influence on Cloud (per update cycle)

**Formula:** `pressure_delta = zone.qbit_aggregate * QBIT_PRESSURE_SCALE`
**Constant:** `QBIT_PRESSURE_SCALE = 0.0002`

| Zone | QBIT Aggregate | Pressure Contribution |
|------|----------------|-----------------------|
| FC-ARCADE | 6112 | +1.22 per cycle |
| SERVICE_HALL | 4134 | +0.83 per cycle |
| CORRIDOR | 2786 | +0.56 per cycle |
| ATRIUM | 1963 | +0.39 per cycle |

**Total entity pressure contribution:** +3.0 per update cycle

This accounts for **15% of total Cloud pressure** (per integrated WEIGHT_ENTITY = 0.15).

**Projected Cloud buildup:**
- 10 updates: +30 Cloud pressure (entity contribution alone)
- 50 updates: +150 Cloud pressure (would hit CRITICAL threshold at 75+)

With player actions (50%), NPC events (25%), and drift (10%), Cloud can realistically reach CRITICAL (75+) within 30-40 update cycles under normal gameplay.

---

## Resonance Amplification Matrix

**Formula:** `resonance_gain *= (1 + (zone.qbit_charisma / 3000) * 0.5)`

| Zone | Charisma | Resonance Multiplier | Effect |
|------|----------|---------------------|--------|
| FC-ARCADE (composite) | 1380 avg | 1.23x | Discoveries stick 23% better |
| SERVICE_HALL | 1298 | 1.22x | 22% faster memory accumulation |
| CORRIDOR | 1308 | 1.22x | 22% boost |
| ATRIUM | 1412 | 1.24x | 24% boost |

**Gameplay impact:** Players discovering artifacts in FC-ARCADE will accumulate resonance 23% faster than in low-charisma zones. This creates a natural "memory hotspot" around high-QBIT areas.

---

## Artifact Discoverability Ratings

**Formula:** `weight = entity.charisma / 3000` (scaled to 0-1.0)

| Artifact | Charisma | Weight | Discoverability |
|----------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Orange Julius Stand | 1500 | 0.50 | HIGH |
| Mirror Maze Token | 1140 | 0.38 | MEDIUM |
| Leisurely Leon | 1134 | 0.38 | MEDIUM |

**Orange Julius Stand** is 32% more discoverable than Mirror Maze Token. AO3 logs and memory fragments will naturally "prefer" zones containing high-charisma artifacts.

---

## Contradiction Threshold Analysis

**Base threshold:** Cloud 75 (CRITICAL)

### NPCs with Modified Thresholds

| NPC | Power | Threshold | Delta | Can Contradict At |
|-----|-------|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| The Janitor | 1478 | 70 | -5 | Cloud 70+ |
| Al Gorithm | 864 | 75 | 0 | Cloud 75+ |
| Wife (at Bookstore) | 320 | 75 | 0 | Cloud 75+ |

**The Janitor** is the ONLY entity that can trigger contradictions below Cloud 75. This makes him the "early warning system" for approaching Bleed events.

**Narrative sequence:**
1. Cloud reaches 70: Janitor can contradict (crosses FC-ARCADE threshold)
2. Cloud reaches 75: All NPCs can contradict (reality breaks)
3. Cloud reaches 80: Bleed Tier 2 (visual + NPC contradictions guaranteed)

---

## Expansion Recommendations

### Phase 2: More Anchor NPCs

To reach anchor candidate threshold (3000+ overall), new entities need:
- **High grassroots support:** 10,000+ (social recognition)
- **High backing volume:** 100,000+ (structural weight)
- **Deep view count:** 5,000,000+ (accumulated attention)

**Potential candidates:**
- Security Guard (primary NPC, high power)
- Mall Manager (primary NPC, max backing volume)
- Fountain (zone/artifact hybrid, high charisma)
- Missing Escalator (anomaly, high contradiction potential)

### Phase 3: Zone Diversity

Current gap: No entities in ENTRANCE, KIOSK, THEATER

**Recommended entities:**
- Entrance: "First Step Memory" (artifact, temporal anchor)
- Kiosk: "Perfume Sample Lady" (NPC, sensory anchor)
- Theater: "Empty Screen Glow" (anomaly, liminal)

### Phase 4: Swarm Integration

Create low-power, low-charisma "background entities":
- Swarm NPC templates (overall 100-300)
- Background artifacts (overall 50-150)
- Ambient sounds (overall 200-400)

These fill out the QBIT ecology without overwhelming high-influence zones.
